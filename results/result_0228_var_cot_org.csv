1,1,"[(12, 3)]",2.240550212,11.81355651,3,3,3,"To deduce the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model with the provided data, let's go step by step:

1. **Understand the Newsboy Model**: The model seeks to minimize the total cost of inventory, including both the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too few items (underage cost). The optimal order quantity balances these costs based on the probability distribution of demand.

2. **Analyze the Provided Data**:
    - Given data: [(12, 3)], where 12 is the order quantity and 3 is the observed demand.
    
    With only one data point, it's challenging to estimate a probability distribution of demand accurately. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's proceed by considering we would need more data for a precise model in real-world scenarios.

3. **Define Costs**:
    - Selling Price (P): $11
    - Overage Cost (Co): $4 per item (The cost of ordering too many, equal to the ordering cost in this context)
    - Underage Cost (Cu): This can be calculated as P - Co since the underage cost is the profit lost by having too few items. Thus, Cu = $11 - $4 = $7.

4. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (Cr)**: The critical ratio is used to find the optimal service level and is calculated as the cost of underestimating demand (Cu) divided by the total cost (Cu + Co).
    - Cr = Cu / (Cu + Co) = $7 / ($7 + $4) = 7 / 11 â‰?0.636.

5. **Find the Optimal Service Level**: In the newsboy model, the optimal service level is the probability at which the expected benefit of ordering one more item equals the cost. Given the lack of a demand distribution, we cannot directly calculate this probability or associate it with a quantile of demand. However, the critical ratio gives us a hint at what the optimal service level should look like if we had a demand probability distribution.

6. **Estimate Optimal Order Quantity (Q\*)**: Typically, you would use the critical ratio and the probability distribution of demand to find the optimal order quantity. With inadequate data to form a probability distribution, we cannot precisely determine Q\*. Strategies in such sparse data scenarios could involve estimating demand based on market trends, similar product sales, or more historical data.

Given the sole data point (12, 3) and the mathematical context explained, the process highlights the importance of adequate demand data and implies an approximation method for Q\*. Without additional demand data or a presumed demand distribution, specifying an exact Q\* value based on the newsboy model principles does not fully apply.

However, if we consider the intention of understanding the process and needing a placeholder action, a conservative approach could be to set the next order quantity close to observed demand plus a buffer for variability until more data allows for a refined estimate.

Hence, taking a very simplistic view and without a precise way to apply the model formula due to data limitations:

Q\* = 3 (for simplicity, as a direct application of model insights is constrained by the data provided).

This is not a direct application of the newsboy model but a simplified step given the limitations. For accurate calculations, more detailed demand distribution data is necessary.

1,2,"[(4, 2)]",2.040311034,6.805438377,2,2,.,"To deduce the optimal order quantity for the next day based on the provided historical data [(4, 2)] using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Model**: The newsboy model is used to find the optimal order quantity that minimizes the risk of overstocking and understocking. The model focuses on a single-period inventory situation, typically modeling scenarios like ordering newspapers for sale in a day, where unsold items have no value at the end of the day.

2. **Data Analysis**: From the provided data [(4, 2)], we have just one day of data where the order quantity was 4, and the demand was 2.

3. **Model Parameters**:
   - Selling price per unit = $11
   - Ordering cost (overage cost) per unsold item = $4
   There's no given salvage value for unsold items, so we assume it to be $0 unless stated otherwise. Underage cost (the cost of underordering) can be deduced as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. However, we don't have a direct cost price, just the overage cost.

4. **Calculate Critical Ratio**: The critical ratio (CR) is found using the formula \[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\], where:
   - \(Cu\) is the underage cost, which is the profit lost by not having an item to sell (\$11 - cost price per unit). Since we haven't been given the cost price, we might consider the profit per unit directly as the selling price minus the ordering cost, although this interpretation might vary based on specific case understanding. Given lack of direct cost price, an assumption can be made, or we adjust our calculations accordingly.
   - \(Co\) is the overage cost, which is the cost of ordering one too many items (\$4 in this case).

Without the direct cost price or the underordering cost (which is ideally the net profit per unit), we might either need to make assumptions or revise our approach to consider the given data points (selling price and overage cost) to deduce the demand forecast or probability, which isn't straightforward given only one day of data.

5. **Optimal Order Quantity Decision**: Ideally, with a complete dataset, we could:
   - Estimate the demand distribution.
   - Use the critical ratio to find the percentile of this distribution that matches.
   - Order that quantity which aligns with this CR as the optimal order quantity.

Given our constraints and the singular data point, making statistical inferences is impractical. Direct application of the classic newsvendor model with missing comprehensive data limits precise calculation. However, if adapting the selling price as a proxy for Cu, assuming we want to avoid lost sales more than overage (which may be a significant assumption), let's do a simplified thought process:
   
For a simplistic view, if \(Cu >> Co\), we would order more to avoid stockouts, given the high lost opportunity cost. Conversely, if \(Co\) is nearing \(Cu\), we'd be conservative in ordering due to higher costs of overage relative to the lost sales cost.

Without perfect information, the optimal order quantity in a strictly data-driven sense can't be accurately determined from a single data point [(4, 2)] for a sophisticated model like the newsboy.

6. **Simplification for a Determination**:
Given we must provide an answer and guided by the principle of minimizing overage while handling underage cautiously, and given the singular nature of our data point alongside lacking some critical information:

For a model heavily relying on probabilities and cost balancing, and without assuming additional data or making extensive assumptions, it's challenging to precisely define ""optimal"" based on given. However, given that demand observed was less than the order, and without further info, a conservative approach might suggest ordering close to observed demand if overage is a concern, especially with only the selling price and overage cost provided.

**Optimal Order Quantity for the Next Day**: Without the ability to perform a detailed analysis due to data and information constraints:

This is a highly simplified and conservative estimate purely for the purpose of concluding with a number, focusing on avoiding overage cost, using the demand observed directly. In practice, more data and a clearer cost structure would be essential for a precise calculation."
1,3,"[(2, 2)]",6.141068393,3.480532379,15,2,.,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model with the provided historical order and demand data, let's apply the steps systematically.

**Step 1: Understand the concepts.**  
The newsboy model is used to decide the optimal level of inventory to order for a single period of demand, balancing between the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too little (underage cost, which is essentially the lost profit from not meeting demand).

**Given Data:**  
- Selling price per unit: $11  
- Ordering cost per unit (Overage cost): $4  
- Historical data: [(2, 2)]

**Overage cost (C_o):** This is the cost of ordering one unit too many, which, in this case, is the ordering cost of $4 since any excess can't be sold and thus represents a loss equal to the cost of ordering that extra unit.

**Underage cost (C_u):** This is the lost profit for ordering one unit too little, calculated as the selling price minus the cost per unit. However, since we're not given a separate cost price, we'll consider the cost as the opportunity cost of not selling, which is the selling price ($11) minus the ordering cost ($4), thus $7.

**Step 2: Calculate the critical ratio (CR).**  
The critical ratio is calculated as C_u / (C_u + C_o), which represents the service level or the probability of meeting demand.

Using the given costs:
\[ C_u = \$11 - \$4 = \$7 \]
\[ C_o = \$4 \]

\[ CR = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \]

\[ CR = \frac{7}{11} \]

**Step 3: Apply the CR to demand data.**  
The historical data is minimal, with just one data point showing that demand met the order quantity exactly (2 units). This doesn't give us variability or distribution to apply the CR directly for optimizing future orders based on historic demand variance. Normally, you'd use the CR against a probability distribution of demand to find where the critical fractile matches or exceeds CR.

However, given the constraints and focusing on the theoretical application of the newsboy model to the provided single data point, we must rely on the assumption that demand can vary and the need to make a decision under uncertainty with limited data.

**Step 4: Deduce the optimal order quantity.**  
The key to the newsboy model is balancing the costs of overage and underage to minimize expected total cost. With only one data point (2, 2), and no explicit distribution of demand, our calculation based on CR may suggest keeping orders closely aligned with anticipated demand - though this single data point suggests demand perfectly matched the order quantity in one instance.

Given the constraints and using the critical ratio, in a real-world scenario, you would look for a more extensive distribution of demand to find where the cumulative probability of demand matches or exceeds the CR calculated. Since we can't do that with one data point, we could interpret the optimal order quantity as needing to be as close as possible to a demand that would match the critical ratio, adjusting for any observed trends or expectations not explicitly provided here.

Since there's not enough data to make a statistically significant adjustment, and without additional context or a distribution of demand, we might consider the observed order and demand data as a basic starting point, but also factor in the calculated CR to err on the side of ordering slightly more, expecting potential demand variability.

**Conclusion:**
Given the very limited data and the simplistic approach required here, the optimal order quantity can't be definitively calculated without making several assumptions. However, knowing our CR suggests we should be somewhat conservative but also prepared to meet demand to maximize profits and minimize losses.

As there's no clear way to adjust based on a single data point without more context, and to give a definitive answer as requested:

\[ \text{Optimal Order Quantity for the Next Day} = 2 \]

It's important to note in practice, with more data you'd use probabilities of demand exceeding certain levels to align more closely with the CR ratio for precise optimization."
1,4,"[(13, 5)]",6.594866844,12.87092615,6,5,3,"To solve for the optimal order quantity using the newsvendor (or newsboy) model, we adhere to the model's principle of balancing the costs associated with ordering too much versus ordering too little. The provided data includes one day's order quantity and demand as well as the selling price and the overage cost (ordering cost). However, the salvage value or the cost of unsold items is not directly provided but can be inferred from the given data.

Given:
- Order quantity and demand for one day: (13, 5)
- Selling price ($SP) = $11
- Ordering cost (Overage cost or $C_o) = $4

Since the demand is lower than the order quantity in the given example, we can infer the critical ratio needed for the Newsboy model calculation.

First, let's understand the basic components:
1. **Critical Ratio (CR)**: The ratio of the cost of underordering (Cu) to the total of the costs of underordering (Cu) and overordering (Co). The cost of underordering is essentially the lost profit per unit, while the cost of overordering is the difference between the purchase cost and the salvage value (if any), but here it's directly given as $4.
   
   The critical ratio is calculated as follows:
   \[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]
   
   Where:
   - Cu = $SP - Cost price (CP); the cost price isn't directly given, but we can deduce it based on the overage cost ($4) if we assume the unsold units can't be sold later (implying that the salvage value is $0, a common assumption in many Newsvendor model problems for simplification).
   - Co = $C_o = $4

First, we need to deduce the **Cost Price (CP)**. Since we don't have direct information about the CP but know the overage cost, we might initially misinterpret our needs to find the CP directly. Knowing the overage cost and the selling price, we should actually focus on calculating the lost profit per unsold item as our cost of underordering (Cu), which is simply the selling price minus any additional costs we could be neglecting (or, for the sake of this calculation, focusing solely on the selling price to compute the profit margin lost). Therefore, without the purchase cost but understanding the context, our aim shifts to defining the critical ratio (CR) correctly to proceed with the calculation.

Given our context:
- Assuming salvage value is $0 (units unsold carry no following day value), Cu is essentially the selling price in this simple model because no direct Cost Price is given nor relevant for the calculation step needing completion.

Considering this, if we're thinking about the lost revenue (or profit) per unsold item (as opposed to certain cost structures), Cu could be designated as the selling price, making our rationale to focus on how Cu is representative of the unrealized profit ($11) in this specific instance for model applicability. Co remains at $4.

So, in a simplified realignment considering the data given and the standard methodology:
- Cu = $SP = $11 in context to the problem's structure emphasizing revenue loss as our concern.
- Co = $4

Then,
\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{11}{11 + 4} = \frac{11}{15} \]

CR calculates to 0.73 (repeating).

This critical ratio implies that the optimal order quantity should be set where the probability of selling that quantity is equal to 0.733..., given a probability distribution of demand which we don't have. In the real world, or a detailed analysis, you would apply this critical ratio to your demand distribution (e.g., historical demand data) to find the exact quantity where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand equals or slightly exceeds 0.73.

Given we only have one day's data, which is insufficient to construct a full demand distribution or reliably use statistical methods to predict exact demand. Thus, we cannot accurately apply the CR to deduce an exact optimal order quantity without more data or assumptions regarding demand variability or distribution.

However, if we aimed to use this singular point of data (13 ordered, 5 demanded) to influence our decision simplistically without statistical robustness, it would be an imprudent application of the model as it lacks the necessary demand distribution insight. Therefore, we must highlight that with only one day's data point, the model's intricate application to deduce an 'optimal' next order quantity specifically through the Newsvendor formula isn't justly feasible.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on following instructions while highlighting necessary caution about the model's application due to data limitations:

13"
1,5,"[(4, 4)]",8.214473135,4.23482146,19,4,4,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy model (also known as the single-period model), we need to follow certain steps based on the given data. The primary goal of this model is to find a balance between the costs of ordering too many and too few items. The formula involves finding a critical ratio that balances these costs, which then helps in determining the optimal order quantity.

Let's use the provided selling price, overage cost, and data to deduce the steps:

1. **Understand the given data**: We have tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day. In this case, we have only one tuple: (4, 4). This means on that day, 4 units were ordered, and the demand was exactly 4 units.

2. **Define the parameters**:
   - Selling price per unit = \$11
   - Overage (ordering) cost per unit = \$4
   - Since the underordering cost isn't provided explicitly, we calculate it as the difference between the selling price and the overage cost, which is \( \$11 - \$4 = \$7 \). This is the profit lost for each unit not ordered to meet demand.

3. **Calculate the critical ratio (CR)**: The CR is the ratio of the underordering cost to the sum of the overage cost and the underordering cost. In formula terms, \( CR = \frac{Underordering \ Cost}{Underordering \ Cost + Overage \ Cost} \).
   
   Plugging in the numbers, \( CR = \frac{\$7}{\$7 + \$4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \).

4. **Determine the optimal order quantity**: Normally, we would use the CR to find the percentile of demand that corresponds to it, effectively determining how much to order to not exceed this threshold of risk. However, with the given data (just one tuple), we don't have a distribution of past demands to calculate a more precise optimal order quantity. In a typical scenario, we'd look at past demand, calculate the demand distribution, and find the demand level that corresponds to the critical ratio.

Given the single data point, the only demand observed has been exactly 4 units. Without more distribution data, the most straightforward approach is to consider this demand level as a starting point but recognize it's based on very limited information.

5. **Adjust and conclude**: Ideally, with more data points (more tuples of order quantity and observed demand), we could better approximate the demand distribution and compute a more accurate optimal order quantity for the next day. We consider the need for a balance between risk (of leftovers) and the opportunity (meeting or exceeding demand).

Due to the lack of a proper distribution to apply the CR, and based on the given single data point where demand met supply perfectly, our best initial estimate with the information available is to match that previous demand.

**Optimal order quantity for the next day**: 4"
1,6,"[(2, 2)]",8.211451819,3.17212168,15,2,],"To apply the newsboy (or newsvendor) model to deduce the optimal order quantity for the next day using the provided historical order and demand data, we follow a series of steps. The newsboy model aims to balance the costs of overage (ordering too much) and underordering (ordering too little), comparing the marginal cost of ordering one more unit to the marginal benefit of ordering that unit.

Given:
- Selling price per unit = $11
- Overage (ordering) cost per unit = $4

The provided historical data is: [(2, 2)], which means on that day, the order quantity was 2, and the demand was also 2.

Step 1: Calculate the Underage Cost (Cu)
Underage cost is the lost profit for each unit underordered, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost of ordering one more unit. 
\[Cu = Selling\:price - Cost\:of\:ordering = 11 - 4 = 7\]

Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio is the fraction of the underage cost (Cu) over the sum of the underage and overage costs (Cu + Co), where Co is the cost of overordering, which in this context, equals the ordering cost.
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

Step 3: Match the Critical Ratio to Demand Probability
Now, we need to find the probability of demand that matches or closely approximates the critical ratio. However, with only one day of historical data (demand equal to 2), we can't accurately compute a demand distribution.

Since we can't calculate a precise probability distribution of demand from the provided data alone, we must make an assumption or use additional data to accurately estimate the optimal order quantity based on demand probabilities that match the CR.

Given the limitation here, we typically would look at the demand trends, or at least a wider range of historical data, to estimate where the demand probability equals or is just above 7/11. Unfortunately, without additional data or a distribution, we must acknowledge the limitation in providing a precise optimal order quantity based solely on the given tuple.

In real-world application, businesses often accumulate more data over time to better estimate demand probabilities and apply the newsboy model more accurately.

Assuming a broader understanding of demand is required to apply the CR accurately, for now, we would suggest examining more days of order and demand data to estimate a demand probability distribution. Typically, businesses adjust their order quantities based on observed demand patterns, aiming to closely match the critical ratio for optimal inventory levels.

Given only a single data point in this example, if we were to proceed conservatively without further demand insights, one might consider ordering slightly above the previous demand (which was met perfectly) to potentially capture any slight increase in demand, yet without specific probability data, this remains speculative.

Optimal order quantity for the next day:

\[2\]"
1,7,"[(11, 8)]",8.260860714,10.28040827,9,8,8,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we'll follow the steps based on the provided historical order and demand data: \((11, 8)\), with a selling price of $11 and an ordering (overage) cost of $4.

### Step 1: Understand the Data
- One tuple is provided:
  - Order Quantity: \(11\)
  - Observed Demand: \(8\)

### Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio
The newsboy model relies on determining the critical ratio, which helps balance the cost of having too much inventory (overage) against the cost of having too little (underage). The critical ratio (CR) is calculated as follows:
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\]
where:
- \(Cu\) = Cost of underage (cost of having too little stock), which is the missed profit per unit = Selling Price - Cost = \(11 - 4 = 7\).
- \(Co\) = Cost of overage (cost of having too much stock), which is the cost per unit = $4.

Plugging the values:
\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

### Step 3: Analyze Demand Data
Given the limited data ((11, 8)), we lack a distribution of demand to calculate the exact optimal order quantity directly from this data point.  However, the CR can guide the decision-making process.

### Step 4: Estimate Optimal Order Quantity
In a comprehensive analysis, we would look at the probability of demand reaching certain levels and match it to the critical ratio to identify at what demand level the probability equals the CR. However, given the single data point, this approach simplifies to acknowledging that the optimal order should somewhat reflect the demand tendency observed while considering the calculated CR.

### Step 5: Simplified Deduction
Usually, we would use the CR to find the demand probability that matches or is closest to this ratio. With detailed demand data (a distribution curve), we'd look for the demand \(D\) for which \(P(D â‰?d)\) is as close as possible to the CR. In practice, this often involves looking at historical demand distribution, which is not provided here.

Given the lack of detailed information and the reliance on a single day's data, the deduction highly simplifies the process. A comprehensive analysis would incorporate more variability and historical data. 

Considering the limited information but understanding the importance of aligning with the CR, the single data point shows demand at 8 against an order of 11, indicating overordering. While the CR suggests aiming to optimize based on the balance of under and overage costs, without further demand distribution data, a nuanced calculation isn't possible. The thought process suggests considering closer alignment towards observed demand but tempered by the knowledge that future demand can vary.

### Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day:
Given the simplicity of the model application here, we default towards a very rudimentary adjustment considering the single observed data point and the CR. The optimal order quantity should ideally be informed by a pattern or distribution, which isn't available. However, aligning closer to the observed demand while contemplating a margin for variability might be considered a cautious approach.

Without a distribution to analyze, we lean on the observed data while considering the CR for a more informed guess rather than a calculated decision. The exact optimal order quantity cannot be pinpointed from the information provided without making several assumptions.

However, a basic recommendation could slightly adjust upwards from the single data point of 8, considering potential variability in demand, but without further information, this adjustment is speculative.

**Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day:** 8"
1,8,"[(9, 3)]",2.888513187,8.086011798,3,3,5,"To find the optimal order quantity using the **newsboy model** (also known as the Newsvendor model), we'll analyze the provided data and apply the relevant formulas. The model helps in determining the optimal inventory level, considering the costs of having too much or too little inventory. In this case, we have tuples indicating the order quantity and observed demand for each day. However, we only have a single observation: (9, 3).

Given:
- Selling price per unit = $11
- Overage cost (ordering cost) per unit = $4

In the Newsvendor model, the critical ratio (CR) is calculated as follows:
\[ CR = \frac{P - C}{P + S - C} \]
Where:
- \(P\) is the selling price
- \(C\) is the cost of purchasing (in this case, the overage or ordering cost)
- \(S\) is the salvage value (if not given, it can be assumed to be 0, meaning unsold items have no value, or in some contexts, it might be equal to the cost, assuming you can return unsold units at the cost price)

Given our particulars:
- \(P = 11\)
- \(C = 4\)
- \(S = 0\) (assuming unsold items cannot be sold again or returned)

Plugging the values into the CR formula:
\[ CR = \frac{11 - 4}{11 + 0 - 4} = \frac{7}{7} = 1 \]

However, it's important to note that with only a single data point (9,3), we have minimal insight into the probability distribution of demand. Typically, the Newsvendor model assumes some distribution of demand (often normal distribution), and the CR is used to determine the optimal ordering point within that distribution.

Given only a single day's data, it's impossible to accurately estimate the distribution of demand. Therefore, we must rely on the given data point and intuition rather than statistical precision. In this case, it seems we ordered 9 units but only had demand for 3 units, indicating a significant overestimation of demand.

The optimal order quantity calculation typically relies on finding a quantity that aligns with the critical ratio and the distribution of demand. With insufficient data to inform a probability distribution, we might instead consider a more cautious approach for the next order.

Given the limitations of our data, let's reframe this scenario slightly:
- We aim to minimize overage costs while still trying to meet demand as closely as possible.
- The data shows we significantly overestimated demand.

Without additional data points or a clear demand distribution, the safest choice might be to adjust our order quantity based on observed demand and the understanding that our previous order was substantially higher than needed.

Considering these factors and the fact that this specific application of the Newsvendor model may not yield a precise optimal quantity from just one observation, let's reflect: A cautious approach could be to order in line with or slightly above observed demand, acknowledging that we're unable to accurately apply the CR because we lack a distribution of demand. Ordering significantly more than the single observed demand of 3, without evidence to support higher demand, seems unwise.

Yet, to comply with the constraints of your request for a single-number output representing the next day's optimal order quantity and considering we ordered much more than the demand, a slightly conservative approach â€?aiming a bit above the observed demand to catch potential variability but not as high as 9 â€?could be prudent.

Thus, making an educated guess rather than a calculation strictly by the Newsvendor model, and aiming to find a middle ground that could potentially capture an increment in demand, an optimal order quantity might be:

\[ \text{Optimal order quantity} \approx 5 \]

This attempt to balance between observed demand and the possibility of slightly increased demand should not be seen as a definitive Newsvendor model outcome but rather a pragmatic choice given the extremely limited data.

1,9,"[(4, 4)]",6.351374721,3.603652532,19,4,4,"To deduce the optimal order quantity for the next day using the **newsboy model** (also known as the Newsvendor model), we need to calculate the critical ratio first, and then find the optimal order quantity that corresponds to this critical ratio in the demand distribution. The provided dataset is quite small, with only a single tuple representing both the ordered quantity and the observed demand for a day, which is `(4, 4)`. However, we'll proceed with the given information to illustrate the process.

### Step 1: Identifying the Variables

- **Selling Price (P) = $11**
- **Ordering (Overage) Cost (C) = $4**

This overage cost is the cost of ordering one unit too many, which is essentially the loss incurred from not selling the item (this can include the cost of the item itself and any additional costs associated with possessing the surplus item).

### Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)

The critical ratio is calculated as follows:

\[CR = \frac{P - C}{P} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11}\]

### Step 3: Find the Optimal Order Quantity

In the typical newsboy model application, after finding the critical ratio, we would look into the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the demand to find the optimal order quantity that corresponds to this critical ratio. However, with only a single observation, we can't construct a meaningful demand distribution. Therefore, we'll approach this by discussing a more generalized methodology without focusing on distribution specifics due to the lack of provided data points.

Given that we are limited by the data to basically one data point `(4, 4)`, it indicates that when 4 units were ordered, 4 units were sold. There's no direct indication of unsatisfied demand (i.e., we don't know if more could have been sold), nor is there a clear indication of excess inventory, other than no excess was observed for this particular order quantity. 

This poses a challenge in applying the newsboy model directly as it stands but theoretically, if we consider the CR calculated, it suggests we should aim to set our order quantity at a point where we believe the probability of selling that quantity is equal to the CR. Given the lack of distribution data, we would ideally look at more historical data to understand demand patterns and apply the CR appropriately.

However, based on the single point provided and without additional demand indicators, our starting point would practically be the only observed demand/sales data point.

### Conclusion

Given the constraints and the information provided, in a real-world scenario, additional demand data across multiple periods would be essential for a more accurate forecast and subsequent application of the newsboy model. In the interest of making a data-driven decision with very limited information, one might consider testing the waters near the observed demand scale while keeping in mind the critical ratio's indication to adjust inventory in response to perceived demand likelihoods versus the cost risks.

- **Cu**: The cost of under-ordering (underage cost), calculated as the selling price minus the cost per unit (since we donâ€™t have a separate production cost, the ordering cost is considered here). However, the selling price is more relevant for unsatisfied demand, so Cu calculations will be corrected accordingly.

Cu is essentially the profit lost per unit when we do not have enough inventory to meet demand. Since the selling price is given, we calculate Cu as:

- **Cu = P - Co = 11 - 4 = 7.**

### Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)

The critical ratio (CR) helps us determine the optimal inventory level. It is calculated as 

\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]

Given,

- **Cu = 7**
- **Co = 4**

So,

\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

### Step 4: Analyze Demand Data

With our dataset only containing a single entry, it's challenging to accurately predict future demand patterns or establish a probability distribution for demand. However, the newsboy model typically requires establishing demand probabilities to identify where the cumulative distribution meets or exceeds the CR value.

Given the limitation in data variability (only one entry), this step suggests we consider the observed demand as an indicator but remain cautious about over-relying on it for establishing a pattern.

### Step 5: Determine Optimal Order Quantity

Given the very limited data (a single day's figure), if we were to leverage it alongside the CR for a simplistic analysis or a more in-depth probabilistic approach, we'd want to match our ordering strategy to meet or slightly exceed the demand probability that corresponds to our CR of approximately 0.636. In practice, this would involve assessing where the demand probability distribution equals or just exceeds 0.636.

However, without a clearly defined demand distribution and considering the single observation (21 ordered, 6 demanded), a recommendation strictly following the newsboy model's principle would either necessitate more data for precise calculation or a rough estimate informed by the CR. Given the historical demand has shown to be significantly lower than the order quantity, and without further data points to establish a variability pattern or distribution, the exercise becomes speculative.

In the real-world application of this model, we would calculate or estimate the demand distribution's percentile that corresponds to our CR, then order accordingly. For this scenario, more demand data points are needed for a mathematically robust decision.

### Conclusion

Without additional data points to accurately construct a demand distribution, we can't concretely pinpoint an optimal order quantity beyond speculative adjustment based on CR and the available anecdote. For practical purposes and given the data limitations, the ordered quantity might need cautious adjustment considering the vast overshoot observed.

Given the single data point and the simplistic overview, informed adjustments suggest considering orders closer to observed demand, but with a buffer for potential demand upturns. An educated guess, leaning on caution and the high overage cost relative to under-ordering cost, would advocate for a conservative approach.

**Optimal Order Quantity for the Next Day:** 6"
1,11,"[(13, 6)]",4.949376368,13.44613985,7,6,.,"To deduce the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the provided data: [(13, 6)], where the first number in each tuple represents the order quantity and the second number represents the observed demand for that day, let's follow the model systematically:

### Step 1: Understanding the Model

The newsboy model aims to determine the optimal inventory level that minimizes the costs associated with underordering and overordering. The critical ratio in the newsboy model is defined as:

\[ \text{Critical Ratio (CR)} = \frac{\text{Cu}}{\text{Cu} + \text{Co}} \]

Where:
- \( \text{Cu} \) is the cost of underordering (lost profit per unit of unmet demand), which is the selling price minus the ordering cost.
- \( \text{Co} \) is the cost of overordering (ordering cost per unit).

### Step 2: Calculate Costs

Given in the problem:
- Selling price = \$11
- Ordering cost (overage cost) = \$4

Hence, the cost of underordering (Cu) = Selling price - Ordering cost = \( \$11 - \$4 = \$7 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)

\[ \text{CR} = \frac{\text{Cu}}{\text{Cu} + \text{Co}} = \frac{\$7}{\$7 + \$4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

### Step 4: Understanding the Demand Data

The provided data [(13, 6)] shows that on a given day, 13 units were ordered, but the demand was only for 6 units. To apply the newsboy model effectively, we ideally need more data points to estimate the demand distribution accurately. However, with insufficient data, we will proceed with the understanding that we might only be able to provide a preliminary recommendation.

### Step 5: Estimate Demand Distribution

Since we only have a single data point, we can't accurately estimate the demand distribution. In real-world applications, you would analyze all observed demand data to estimate this. 

### Step 6: Deduce the Optimal Order Quantity

Due to the limitation with a single data point, if we stick to mathematical rigor, we're unable to deduce an ""optimal"" order quantity based on the newsboy model's principles since the model typically requires a distribution of demand data to calculate service level or fill rate aligned with the critical ratio.

However, for the sake of progressing with what we're given, let's focus on improving the decision-making based on the observed data and critical ratio calculated:

1. **Critical ratio insight**: A CR of approximately 0.6364 suggests that to minimize the costs of overage and underage, we should aim for a fill rate or service level of about 63.64% of the time meeting demand.
2. **Data insight**: Since the demand observed was significantly lower than the order quantity (6 demand vs. 13 ordered), and without further demand distribution data, one might consider reducing the order quantity to better align with observed demand, while taking the CR into consideration.

Given these insights and the limitation of data, a conservative approach would suggest ordering closer to observed demand but slightly higher to meet the critical ratio. However, without a proper demand distribution estimate, providing a specific ""optimal"" number is challenging.

### Output

Considering all the above, and with a significant acknowledgment of the limitations due to lack of sufficient data, an initial, conservative suggestion might be to slightly increase the order quantity above the observed demand but be cautious of overordering given the single data point.

Since we can't calculate it precisely without more data, as a preliminary suggestion based on a very limited dataset: 

\[ \text{Optimal order quantity} \approx \text{Observed demand} + (\text{A margin to aim for CR}) \]

We might consider ordering a bit more than 6, aiming for service levels suggested by the CR, but this is highly speculative.

**Optimal order quantity for the next day**: 6

This value is not truly ""optimal"" as per the model's requirements due to the limitations outlined, but it aligns with cautious decision-making based on limited data."
1,12,"[(3, 3)]",8.378308137,4.108700274,17,3,],"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we first need to understand the basics of the model. The newsboy model is used to find the optimal inventory level that minimizes costs associated with underordering and overordering. The key parameters are:

1. **Selling price per unit (\(p\))**: The revenue earned for each unit sold, which is \$11 in this case.
2. **Cost per unit (\(c\))**: The cost to order each unit, known as the overage cost in this problem, which is \$4.
3. **Salvage value per unit (\(v\))**: This is the cost recovered for each unsold unit, but it isn't provided directly in this problem. Given the context, we might consider it to be \$0, assuming unsold goods are worthless. However, since the problem description calls the ordering cost the ""overage cost,"" there might be a misunderstanding in terms. Typically, the overage cost is the cost of ordering one too many, which is actually \(c-v\). If ordering cost is mentioned as the overage cost, we'll interpret it according to the conventional definition, which is the cost when demand is less than supply. As such, this model might have a unique interpretation where \(c = 4\) directly represents the loss (or cost) when an item is ordered but not sold.
4. **Demand**: The demand data provided is represented as tuples, in this case, \((3, 3)\).

The critical metric derived from these parameters is the **Critical Ratio (CR)**, calculated as \(\frac{p - c}{p - v}\). Given the ambiguity around the salvage value (\(v\)) and interpreting the provided information as closely as possible to standard terms, we assume \(v = 0\) for our calculation, which simplifies the CR formula to \(\frac{p - c}{p}\).

### Steps to Calculate Optimal Order Quantity

1. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR):**
   With \(p = 11\) and \(c = 4\), and assuming \(v = 0\),
   \[CR = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11}\]

2. **Determine the Probability Distribution of Demand:**
   The problem gives minimal data, only a single tuple \((3, 3)\), suggesting one observation where the demand equaled the order quantity. The sample size is too small to derive a meaningful demand distribution directly. However, for illustrative purposes assuming this is all the data we have, the only observed demand equals the order quantity, so we might incorrectly infer a 100% probability of demand being 3 based on available data. This isn't statistically sound but follows from the given example.

3. **Find the Demand Probability at or Above the CR:**
   With only one data point, and without a meaningful way to calculate cumulative probabilities accurately, a real-world scenario would require more data points for a well-founded decision. In practice, one would look for the demand probability closest to but not less than the CR to determine the optimal order quantity.

Given the constraints and data:

- Based on the given single observation, if we proceeded mechanically, we would mistakenly interpret the CR as indicating the optimality of stocking an inventory that matches the observed demand exactly, with a deeply flawed but strictly followed logic derived from insufficient data.

However, the use of the Newsvendor model with a proper dataset would involve calculating the cumulative probability distribution of demand and selecting the inventory level where the cumulative probability is just equal to or slightly above the critical ratio.

### Conclusion

Given the severely limited data and the outlined interpretation, a statistically robust optimal order quantity cannot be meaningfully deduced. The newsboy model relies on understanding the distribution of demand, which isn't feasible with a single data point. However, following from the provided example:

\[Optimal Order Quantity = 3\]"
1,13,"[(12, 6)]",5.868054669,15.34049815,7,6,6,"To find the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model, we'll follow these steps, taking into consideration the provided data: [(12, 6)], selling price of 11, and overage cost of 4.

1. **Calculate the Probabilities of Demand:** 

    Given the limited data, we only have one observation of demand (6). This doesn't give us a proper distribution to directly apply the newsboy model, which requires probabilities of different demand levels. However, for the sake of explanation, we'll proceed as if this single observation gives us a starting point.

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR):**

    The critical ratio is given by:

    \[
    CR = \frac{Selling\ Price - Ordering\ Cost}{Selling\ Price} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11}
    \]
    
    Hence, CR = 0.636.

3. **Determine the Optimum Order Quantity:**

    Normally, we would use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand to find the demand level where the CDF is as close as possible to but not greater than the CR. This would involve comparing the CR with the probabilities of demand levels.

4. **Given Data Limitations:**

    However, given that our dataset consists of just a single observation, we don't have a distribution to calculate the CDF of demand accurately. In real-world scenarios, we would need more data points to estimate demand probabilities and then use the CR to determine the optimal order quantity.
    
5. **Assumptions for Calculation:**

    If we were to proceed with the assumption that demand could either be equal to or less than the observed demand in our single data point (demand of 6), just for illustrative purposes (which goes against the grain of using the model accurately due to insufficient data), and assuming the probability of maximum demand (6) is equivalent to our CR or less, we could consider ordering up to the demand level that matches our CR.

6. **Conclusion and Next Step:**

    Since we can't accurately apply the model with the available data, the real world application would necessitate collecting more data points on demand across different days. With a single data point, if we were to make a very simplistic assumption that the observed demand could represent a common occurrence (again, this is not statistically robust), the decision might lean towards ordering quantities closer to observed demand considering the costs involved and the critical ratio.

**Given the severe limitations and for the sake of this example, let's put a placeholder for the optimal order quantity as the observed demand (6), acknowledging that in real situations, more data is required for a proper analysis.**

1,14,"[(5, 5)]",4.804617603,8.538572327,21,5,*,"To deduce the optimal order quantity using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, based on the given historical data, we follow several steps. The model is designed to help make decisions under uncertainty, specifically dealing with the question of how much to order when faced with uncertain demand, aiming to balance the costs of overage (having leftover inventory) against the costs of underage (missing out on sales due to insufficient inventory). Here are the relevant parameters and steps:

1. **Review the provided data.**
    - We have tuples representing the order quantity and observed demand for each day; in this case, [(5, 5)]. This means, on this particular day, the order quantity was 5 units, and the demand was also 5 units.

2. **Understand the costs.**
    - The selling price per unit is 11.
    - The overage cost (the cost of ordering too much) is 4 per unit. This essentially is the loss incurred from unsold items, given as the cost of the item less any salvage value, which isn't provided, so we assume the cost here directly.
    - The underage cost, which is the cost of ordering too little, can be calculated as the selling price minus the ordering cost. This represents the profit lost for every unit of unmet demand.

3. **Calculate the underage cost (Cu).**
    - Cu = Selling price - Ordering cost = 11 - 4 = 7.

4. **Calculate the Probability of Demand being less than Order Quantity (P(D<=Q)).**
    - Given the historical data, we calculate this probability to find the service level or the probability of not stocking out.
    - With only one data point where demand equals the order quantity, P(D<=Q) = 1 (or 100%) based on the very limited data.

5. **Deduce the Optimal Service Level (Critical Ratio, CR).**
    - The critical ratio is calculated as Cu / (Co + Cu), where Cu is the underage cost, and Co is the overage cost.
    - CR = Cu / (Cu + Co) = 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11 = 0.6363.

Since we have only one data point, the probability distribution of demand is not clear. However, the newsvendor model's critical ratio provides a way to determine the optimal order quantity by matching it against the demand distribution. Given we do not have a detailed distribution of demand, deriving an exact optimal order quantity directly from the provided data is challenging.

The critical ratio suggests on a very basic level that it's optimal to have enough inventory to meet demand with about a 63.63% confidence level. In reality, with more data points on demand, you would match this critical ratio against the cumulative probability distribution of demand to find the optimal order quantity.

**Based on the very limited data (a single point) provided, and without a more detailed distribution of demand:**

The optimal order quantity directly from the critical ratio or the historical data can't be precisely calculated without assumptions about the demand pattern. However, with a 100% service level observed in the data (demand met exactly), and considering the costs and limited data, sticking close to the historical demand/order quantity might seem reasonable.

Given the complexity and the limitation of having only one data point, let's consider the historical demand as a simple starting point:

**Optimal order quantity for the next day: 5**"
1,15,"[(8, 4)]",7.27014012,6.736760933,5,4,4,"To calculate the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model (also known as the newsvendor model) from the provided historical data, we follow a step-by-step reasoning process. The data gives us a single day's observation of order quantity and observed demand: [(8, 4)]. In this case, the selling price per unit is $11, and the cost of ordering each unit (overage cost) is $4. 

The newsboy model helps determine the optimal order quantity that maximizes expected profit or minimizes expected loss, considering the costs of over-stocking and under-stocking. The critical ratio in this model is determined by the cost of understocking (Cu) (the lost profit per unit of demand not met) and the cost of overstocking (Co) (the lost value per unit of leftover inventory), given by:

\[ Critical\ Ratio = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]

In this case, the cost of understocking (Cu) can be calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Since we only have the overage cost (cost of ordering each unit, $4) instead of the cost price, we'll treat this overage cost as the cost price for our calculation, assuming no additional procurement costs. Hence, if we sold a unit for $11 that cost $4, the lost profit (Cu) for each unit not sold because of understocking would be:

\[ Cu = Selling\ Price - Ordering\ Cost = 11 - 4 = $7 \]

The cost of overstocking (Co) is given as the ordering cost, which is $4 in this scenario. This is the lost value for each unit of excess inventory.

Now, we can compute the critical ratio:

\[ Critical\ Ratio = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

In order to use this critical ratio to determine the optimal order quantity, we would typically match it against a cumulative probability distribution of demand. However, with only one data point provided (order quantity 8, demand 4), we lack a distribution to apply this ratio to. 

In typical situations, you would use several data points of past demand to estimate a demand distribution (e.g., normal distribution). Then, you'd find the demand level at which the cumulative probability matches the critical ratio. That demand level would be your optimal order quantity.

Given we cannot accurately construct a distribution curve or assess a cumulative probability from a single data point, the application of the newsboy model here is limited. Theoretically, with more data on demand, you could generate or estimate a probability distribution for demand and then use the calculated critical ratio to determine the demand level (optimal order quantity) that aligns with that critical ratio.

Since we can't apply the critical ratio directly to determine the exact optimal order quantity without a distribution of demand, a more nuanced analysis or additional data would be necessary for precision.

However, if we strictly follow instructions and aim to derive a number despite the limitations, we cannot precisely apply the newsboy model as intended but might consider ordering closer to past demand (4) while intending to adjust for potential inaccuracies given the single data point.

1,16,"[(3, 3)]",8.992175257,1.117551349,17,3,3,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the ""newsboy model"" or the ""newsvendor model,"" let's break down the calculation steps based on the provided data and the modelâ€™s requirements. The single data point provided is: [(3, 3)], where the first number in the tuple represents the order quantity and the second number represents the observed demand.

### Step 1: Understanding the Model

The newsboy model aims to help in deciding the optimal inventory level to minimize costs associated with ordering too many or too few items. The key variables here are:
- Co = Overordering (overage) cost per unit = $4 (This is when supply exceeds demand.)
- Cu = Underordering (underage) cost per unit = Selling price - Cost = $11 - $4 = $7 (This is when demand exceeds supply.)
  
We calculate the critical ratio (Cu / (Cu + Co)) to determine the optimal service level.

### Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio

The critical ratio = Cu / (Cu + Co) = $7 / ($7 + $4) = 7/11 â‰?0.6364.

### Step 3: Applying Critical Ratio to Demand Data

Given we have only one datapoint, it's challenging to estimate a precise optimal order quantity directly from historical demand variability. However, the critical ratio tells us the proportion of time demand should be met to optimize costs, under the assumption demand follows a certain probability distribution.

### Step 4: Limited Data - Assessing Demand

With just one instance where demand equals the order quantity (3, 3), we don't have variability in the data to apply a probability distribution directly. In real application, more data points would help in estimating demand's distribution and its cumulative distribution function (CDF), from which we'd find the demand level that corresponds to our critical ratio.

### Conclusion

Due to the limitation of having a single data point, we can't directly apply statistical methods to estimate the optimal order quantity. However, assuming the provided order quantity was adequate for that day, and without further data indicating variability in demand, one might consider maintaining the same order level while aiming to collect more data for better insights.

Given the constraints and the model's reliance on understanding demand distribution, the next step in a practical scenario would involve either:
- Assuming demand is relatively stable and using the current order quantity as a starting point.
- Gathering more data points to better estimate demand variability and applying the critical ratio more accurately.

### Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day:

3"
1,17,"[(17, 8)]",4.842808109,19.29451898,9,8,8,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model (also known as the single-period inventory model), we follow these steps, focusing on the given data: [(17, 8)], the selling price of $11, and the overage cost of $4.

1. **Understand the Parameters**:
   - **Demand Data (D)**: Observed demand is given as 8.
   - **Selling Price (p)**: $11 per item.
   - **Ordering Cost (overage cost, c)**: $4 per item.
   - **Salvage Value**: Not directly provided but can be inferred as the difference between the selling price and the overage cost ($11 - $4 = $7).

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio**:
   - The critical ratio (CR) is calculated as \(\frac{p - c}{p}\), where \(p\) is the selling price and \(c\) is the cost (overage cost).
   - With our figures, it would be \(\frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\).

3. **Determine the Corresponding Quantile of the Demand Distribution**:
   - The critical ratio corresponds to the cumulative probability (quantile) of demand we aim to meet.
   - In a real-life scenario, we would match this quantile to the demand distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the optimal order quantity. However, with only a single data point provided, there's insufficient data to accurately determine a demand distribution or its CDF.

4. **Simplification for the Given Task**:
   - Since weâ€™re provided with a single demand observation and lack a distribution, we have to simplify our approach. Normally, this model requires historical demand data to estimate the distribution of future demand.
   - In this simplified scenario, we can interpret the provided data as indicative of possible future demand but can't statistically deduce an optimal quantity without assuming more about demand variance, distribution, etc.

5. **Assumption and Decision**:
   - Given the limitation of one data point, we might intuit that ordering around the observed demand might be prudent, or considering the critical ratio, we might order slightly more, expecting some demand variation.
   - However, making a statistically grounded decision requires assuming a distribution or having a broader dataset.

Since we can't apply the model rigorously with the provided data, and to adhere to the ask of concluding with only the optimal order quantity based on the information given:

Without sufficient data to apply a distribution, but knowing the observed demand was 8 and considering the critical ratio suggests aiming to meet 63.64% of potential demand, the decision is quite subjective. If we were to lean into a logic where we consider the critical ratio in light of given data, our order quantity might slightly exceed observed demand, aiming for inventory that approximates potential maximum demand while considering cost efficiency given the overage cost.

Given a single instance of observed demand (8) and the lack of demand variability information, a simplistic approach might suggest ordering in line with this demand while cautiously adjusting for any anticipated variability. Yet, strictly following the newsboy model principles without clear demand distribution leads to speculative adjustment.

Optimal order quantity for the next day: 8"
1,18,"[(1, 1)]",9.593011599,1.754836203,13,1,1,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model, we'll follow a series of steps based on the provided historical data, which consists of tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand. For this example, our data is: [(1, 1)]. From this, we're given a selling price of $11 and a cost of $4. This model helps us balance the cost of ordering too much against the cost of not having enough to meet demand. 

The newsboy model calculates the optimal order quantity by maximizing the expected profit, taking into consideration the probability of various demand levels. It typically requires an understanding of the distribution of demand, which in this simplified scenario, we'll deduce from provided data. With only one data point, we'll have to make do with very limited information. The formula we're looking to apply considers the cost of overstocking against the cost of understocking and finding the quantity where these costs are balanced, given the probability distribution of demand.

In a more complex scenario, we would calculate the critical ratio which is:

\[Critical\ Ratio = \frac{Selling\ Price - Cost}{Selling\ Price}\]

And then use this to find the demand level (D) where the probability of demand being less than or equal to D equals the critical ratio. However, with only one data point, our ability to determine a probability distribution is severely limited. Thus, we will simplify the calculations, considering the observed demand as a starting point.

Given:
- Selling Price (S) = $11
- Cost (C) = $4

The overage cost per unit is the cost itself since any unsold stock represents money spent without return. In contrast, the underage cost, which is the cost of ordering too little, is the profit forgone, hence $11 (selling price) - $4 (cost) = $7.

For our single data point (1, 1), the demand equals the order quantity, giving us no clear indication of potential overage or underage scenarios. However, we must make a strategic decision for the next order quantity.

Since there's no clear guidance from the data on variability in demand, and to establish reasoning for a single point, we might consider either repeating the same order quantity or adjusting based on hypothetical demand trends or risk tolerance in over/under ordering. The model suggests aligning the order quantity closer to a point where the profit of additional sales would balance out the cost of unsold inventory, considering the $7 profit margin per unit is more significant than the $4 cost, which incentivizes slightly higher ordering to avoid stockouts.

Without varying data points to calculate a more informed critical ratio or a distribution-based decision, and considering the equal weight of the single data point, our determination must lean on the basic given information and the fundamental economic incentive to avoid lost sales due to the higher profit margin compared to the cost.

Therefore, without further ado, considering the limited data and to conclude with a logical yet simplistic approach:

1,19,"[(17, 8)]",8.320601195,15.53302208,9,8,),"To solve this using the newsboy model, we follow the steps below, applying the provided data. The newsboy model helps in determining the optimal order quantity to minimize the costs associated with overstocking and understocking, considering the selling price and the cost of over-ordering.

Given Data:
- Order quantity and demand data: [(17, 8)] (Only one day's data provided, which limits our ability to statistically assess variability, but we'll proceed with the information on hand)
- Selling Price (SP): $11
- Ordering Cost or Overcost (OC): $4

1. **Calculate the Underage Cost (UC):**
Underage cost is the lost profit if the demand exceeds the order quantity. It's the difference between the selling price and the cost price. However, without the cost price explicitly given, let's assume the UC as the selling price minus the ordering cost, which might not give the most accurate depiction but will follow this for our calculations as an approximation.

\[UC = SP - OC = 11 - 4 = $7\]

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR):**
The critical ratio is used to determine the service level and is calculated as:

\[CR = \frac{UC}{UC + OC}\]

Plugging in the values:

\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636\]

3. **Determine the Optimal Service Level:**
In the context of the newsboy model, the optimal service level matches the critical ratio, which represents the probability of not running out of stock. Here, our critical ratio is approximated as 0.636, indicating roughly a 63.6% service level. 

4. **Applying the Service Level:**
Since we only have one day's data, we cannot apply statistical methods directly to determine the precise order quantity matching a 63.6% chance of meeting demand. 

For a more advanced, data-rich scenario, you'd typically use the critical ratio to find the quantile in demand distribution, requiring historical demand patterns beyond a single observation. Unfortunately, with a single data point (17 ordered, 8 demanded), establishing a comprehensive demand distribution or variability isn't possible, hence not allowing for a direct application of the model as typically described.

Given the limitation, an alternative approach for educational purposesâ€”understanding itâ€™s quite simplified and not strictly following the model due to data constraintsâ€”might involve aligning the order quantity closer to observed demand plus a margin reflecting the service level guideline. 

However, since implementing such a detailed adjustment isn't straightforward with limited data, and typically, we would look at more data points to establish variability and demand distribution to apply the critical ratio more accurately. 

Given the constraints and for simple illustrative purposes, if we were to consider just making an immediate adjustment based on the single observed data point and theoretical CR:

- You'd typically not order less than the demand you've seen unless you have a reason to believe demand will decrease.
- You would consider adjusting your order quantities towards matching or slightly exceeding demand observed, applying a buffer that reflects your critical ratio. Without additional data to refine this approach, you could align with the observed demand while considering factors like upcoming events, trends, or seasonality that might impact demand.

Given the limitations and focusing on a concrete answer based on the simplified scenario:

**Optimal Order Quantity for the Next Day (a single number, illustratively):**

1,20,"[(11, 9)]",9.989274434,8.969739599,10,9,.,"Certainly! Let's break down the steps to use the newsboy (or newsvendor) model to find the optimal order quantity based on the provided data. The newsboy model helps to find a balance between the cost of ordering too many units (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too few (underage cost). Here, we'll use the given data for this process:

- **Data Given**: 
  - Single observation of order quantity and observed demand: (11, 9)
  - Selling price: $11
  - Overage cost (ordering cost): $4

Since we have only one data point, we can't accurately calculate demand variability or probability distributions, which are generally used in the newsboy model. Typically, we would use more data to calculate the probability of selling a certain number of units based on past demand. However, I will guide you through a simplified approach based on the given information.

1. **Determine Costs**:
   - Selling price per unit = $11
   - Ordering cost (overage cost) per unsold unit = $4

2. **Calculate Underage Cost (Cu)**:
    - This is the profit lost by not having an additional unit available for sale when there is demand. In this case, it's the selling price minus the ordering cost ($11 - $4 = $7).

3. **Set up the Newsboy Model Formula**:
    - The critical ratio in the newsboy model is Cu / (Cu + Co), where Cu is the underage cost, and Co is the overage cost. Here, Co (the cost of overordering by one unit) is given directly as $4.

4. **Calculate the Critical Ratio**:
    - Since Cu is $7 (calculated above) and Co is $4, the critical ratio is 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11 â‰?0.6364.

Now, to find the optimal order quantity with a single data point doesn't exactly align with traditional use of the newsboy model which usually requires a distribution of possible demand outcomes to determine the probability that meets this critical ratio. However, given the demand observed (9), and without explicit demand distribution data, we must make a simplified assumption.

The optimal solution typically involves determining the quantity at which the probability of selling that quantity is equal to the critical ratio. Without a distribution, we can only infer that increasing order quantity beyond the observed demand might align with maximizing expected profit, keeping in mind your margin and the fact that your overage cost is lower than your underage cost (profit lost by not having an extra unit).

Given the very limited data, a cautious approach could be taken by slightly increasing the order quantity above the previously observed demand but factoring in the overage and underage costs. However, without explicit probabilities of demand, pinpointing an exact optimal order quantity is more an art in this scenario than a science.

Given these limitations, if the question aims for a recommendation based on the simplistic application of the critical ratio to a singular data point:

This suggests maintaining the order quantity at the previous level, acknowledging that we lack sufficient data to adjust optimally toward expected demand. This stance errs on the conservative side, aligning with the observed demand, expecting to refine with more data."
2,1,"[(8, 1), (11, 1)]",2.048180331,10.61939595,1,1,.,"To deduce the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the provided data, let's go through the process step by step:

### 1. Understanding the Newsboy Model

The newsboy model (also known as the single-period inventory problem) aims to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes profit or minimizes costs when demand is uncertain. The key parameters are:

- **Cu**: Underage cost per unit (Cost of under-ordering = Selling price - Cost)
- **Co**: Overage cost per unit (Cost of over-ordering)

### 2. Determine Cu and Co

Given in the problem:
- Selling price = \$11
- Ordering (overage) cost = \$4

The underage cost (Cu) is the lost profit for each unit by which demand exceeds the order quantity, which is the selling price minus the ordering cost. However, since the cost price is not given, we cannot directly calculate Cu. We can only work directly with the provided information assuming the overage cost represents the loss associated with ordering one unit too many, which is given as Co = \$4.

### 3. Analyze the Provided Data

We have two sets of data points for order quantity and observed demand: 
- Day 1: Ordered = 8, Demand = 1
- Day 2: Ordered = 11, Demand = 1

### 4. Calculate the Probability Distribution of Demand

In this simplified case, we see that the demand in both instances was 1. Thus, based on the very limited dataset, we might infer a probable demand distribution heavily skewed towards lower numbers. However, for the newsboy model, and given only this data, it's challenging to precisely predict a demand pattern or distribution. Typically, a larger dataset is needed for an accurate forecast. Let's proceed with the understanding that our dataset is too limited to accurately model demand distribution but we will apply the theory based on available data.

### 5. Compute the Critical Ratio (CR)

The critical ratio is given by \(CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu+Co}\). Without the direct cost to calculate Cu, we focus on what we do know, the Co and the concept that this ratio helps in determining the optimal service level. 

### 6. Assumption for Simplification

Given we cannot calculate Cu directly from given data and to proceed with a solution, let's hypothetically consider Cu in terms of value lost when not selling what could be sold. If the selling price is \$11 and the overage cost is \$4, one might imply that if we could have sold the item, we lose the opportunity of making \$11 minus the overage of holding it (\$4).

However, without the exact cost price, this interpretation restricts us. Normally, if we knew the cost price, we could more accurately determine Cu.

### 7. Application and Simplification for Solution

Given the above complexities and limitations, we focus on the principle of matching the order quantity with expected demand to minimize potential overage and underage costs. Observing that our demand has consistently been 1, a safe yet conservative order based on just this might also gravitate towards this low end. 

However, in practical application and given the limitation of this data, businesses often apply buffer stock to avoid stockouts. The exact optimal quantity is ideally calculated based on a comprehensive understanding of demand probability, which our dataset does not support.

For the purpose of exercising the approach with available data, if we were to calculate a theoretically optimal order quantity:

### 8. Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day

Given the overage cost and the repeating low demand, an optimal order quantity in a more comprehensive scenario would consider expected demand with associated probabilities. Without a clear demand distribution but observing consistently low demand in the provided data, the model might suggest ordering closer to observed demand, adjusted for risk of stockout.

#### Conclusion
Considering the limitations and objectives:
- Our dataset is too limited to precisely apply the newsboy model's full capabilities.
- We note low demand in both instances (demand = 1).

Thus, the conservative recommendation might directly reflect observed demand plus a minor adjustment for potential unseen demand, without a clear basis to rigorously apply the newsboy model.

However, without further detailed demand probability data and for a purely illustrative purpose based on provided information, our approach towards an ""optimal"" order could lean towards mimicking observed demands plus a minor buffer. 

#### Optimal Order Quantity:
Given the strict limitations and observed demand, we could consider an order slightly above observed demand (1) but calculating an exact ""optimal"" number without proper Cu and a valid demand distribution isn't feasible in this context.

This represents a simplified and highly conservative approach based on the scarcity of provided data, diverging from a precise newsboy model application which requires a detailed understanding of demand probabilities and cost structures."
2,2,"[(6, 1), (11, 5)]",4.87689105,7.811640777,3,5,1,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model with the provided data, we must first understand each component of the model. The newsboy model is a single-period inventory management model that aims to find the optimal order quantity to maximize expected profit or minimize costs when demand is uncertain. The critical variables involved are the selling price per unit, the cost (or overage cost) per unit, and the observed demand.

Given:
- Selling Price ($P$) = 11
- Ordering Cost (Overage Cost) ($C$) = 4
- Data = [(6, 1), (11, 5)]

Letâ€™s dissect the given information.

**Step 1**: Calculate the underage cost. The underage cost ($Cu$) is the lost profit for each unit under-ordered, which is the difference between the selling price and the ordering cost.

\[Cu = P - C = 11 - 4 = 7\]

**Step 2**: Determine the critical ratio. The critical ratio ($CR$) is the ratio of underage cost to the sum of underage and overage costs.

\[CR = \frac {Cu}{Cu + C} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

**Step 3**: Analyze the historical order and demand data. The goal here is to infer demand probabilities, but since only two data points are provided, let's use them to estimate a basic demand pattern or probability. This simplification might not be statistically robust but will allow us to proceed with the example.

Letâ€™s assume for now:
- Demand of 1 occurs with probability 50%.
- Demand of 5 occurs with probability 50%.

More complex models would use finer calculations for demand distribution, but our approximation should suffice for this explanation.

**Step 4**: Using the critical ratio, match it against the cumulative probability distribution of demand to find the optimal order quantity. 

In a detailed model, weâ€™d match $CR$ against a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand. But with simplified probabilities:
- If $CR$ is 7/11, we aim to find where the cumulative probability of demand meets or exceeds 7/11.

However, because we have limited and simplified data, we can't fully apply typical CDF methods. Instead, let's infer.

We know with our approximation:
- Thereâ€™s a 50% (or 0.5) chance demand is 1, and a 50% chance it's higher.

Given a critical ratio of 7/11 (approximately 0.636), we intuit that the optimal order quantity should be aligned with the demand level where the chance of exceeding demand aligns with or is just below the CR. Since our oversimplified model only has two points with equal probability, determining the exact threshold is challenging without more data.

**Step 5**: Choose an optimal order quantity. In our scenario:
- With a simplistic view and recognizing the need for a probability exceeding our critical ratio, but only having two data points and equal probabilities, it might incline us to favor ordering towards the higher observed demand since our CR suggests we're more lenient towards overage than underage given the costs.

Without a more accurate way to calculate the cumulative demand probability, but wanting to lean towards a probability distribution that would justify higher order quantities based on the critical ratio and costs, we might consider:

Since the demand data is not sufficient to precisely apply the Newsboy model, particularly for establishing a detailed demand probability distribution, and given the equal probabilities arbitrarily assigned due to limited data, we shall favor the higher observed demand as a simple approximation, which corresponds more closely to our calculated critical ratio intuition. Therefore, it might be suggestible to lean towards the higher end of observed demands.

2,3,"[(13, 3), (12, 4)]",3.051541354,10.66613278,4,4,*,"Certainly! Let's apply the newsboy model (also known as the single-period inventory problem) to determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the provided historical order and demand data. The steps to deduce the optimal order quantity are as follows:

### Step 1: Understanding the Data
We have been given a set of tuples representing the order quantity and observed demand for each day.
- Day 1: Ordered 13, Demand was 3
- Day 2: Ordered 12, Demand was 4

### Step 2: Define Costs
- Selling price per unit: $11
- Ordering (overage) cost per unit: $4

### Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio
The critical ratio (CR) is calculated as follows:
\[ CR = \frac{Selling Price - Ordering Cost}{Selling Price} \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ CR = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Demand Probability
For the newsboy model, we need to estimate the demand probability for each demand level. Unfortunately, with only two data points, our probability distribution will be rough, but let's proceed on the assumption that these two days give us some indication of demand behavior.
- We observed demand levels of 3 and 4. 

Based on our very limited sample, we can only infer probabilities for these two demand levels without assuming any pattern or distribution for other potential demands.

### Step 5: Making Assumptions due to Limited Data
Due to the scant amount of data, we're constrained in forming a comprehensive demand distribution. For illustration, if we were to assume these two instances indicate possible low-end demand, we would ideally calculate or utilize more data points to form a proper distribution or forecast model. Since detailed extrapolation or prediction is limited by the given data, we'll illustrate the steps and move forward.

### Step 6: Determine the Optimal Order Quantity
Normally, we'd look for the demand quantity where the cumulative probability is just above the CR (0.6364), but our data doesn't directly lead us to this. With demands of 3 and 4, without more to infer from, we're unable to apply a fitting model to project the optimal quantity precisely.

### Given the Constraints:
1. **We acknowledge the limitation due to the lack of a comprehensive demand distribution.**
2. **With only two demand observations and no clear probability distribution, we cannot accurately calculate the exact optimal order quantity traditionally sought in the newsboy model.**

### Step 7: Potential Next Steps for a More Informed Decision
1. Collecting more data on daily demand.
2. Estimating the demand distribution more accurately.
3. Applying the critical ratio to the improved demand distribution to find the optimal order quantity.

### Optimal Order Quantity Deduction
Given the lack of detailed information to adequately project demand probabilities across a spectrum of possible demands, and considering we're asked for a single final line answer without elaboration based on the process stated:

**Given the constraints and acknowledging the theoretical methodology, we cannot directly deduce an optimal order quantity from just two observations without further assumptions or data, hence an exact number can't be provided with high confidence.**

2,4,"[(2, 2), (0, 0)]",6.705060543,1.517550734,15,2,2,"To apply the newsboy model to find the optimal order quantity, we first need to understand the key components of the model, which involves balancing the costs of ordering too much (overage cost) against the costs of ordering too little (underage cost). The overage cost is the cost of ordering one unit more than the demand, and the underage cost is the cost of losing profit by ordering one unit less than the demand.

1. **Calculate the overage cost (Co):** This is given as the ordering cost, which is $4 per unit.

2. **Calculate the underage cost (Cu):** The underage cost is the lost profit for each unit not ordered that could have been sold. This is given by the selling price minus the ordering cost. Thus, Cu = $11 (selling price) - $4 (ordering cost) = $7.

3. **Compute the critical ratio (CR):** The critical ratio is calculated using the formula \(CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\). In this case, CR = \(\frac{7}{7 + 4}\) = \(\frac{7}{11}\) â‰?0.6364.

4. **Analyze historical demand data:** We have two data points: (2, 2) and (0, 0). This means on one day, 2 units were ordered and 2 were sold, and on another day, no units were ordered or sold. Given that we do not have a broad dataset, our demand levels are 0 and 2.

5. **Determine the probability distribution of demand:** From the data,
   - P(demand = 0) = 0.5 (1 out of 2 data points)
   - P(demand = 2) = 0.5 (1 out of 2 data points)

6. **Find the demand probability at or below the critical ratio (CR):** Considering our probabilities and the critical ratio, we look for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) value just below or equal to the CR to determine the optimal order quantity. 

Given the simplicity and lack of granularity in our demand data, we essentially have to make a decision based on the limited demand outcomes we've observed: 0 and 2. However, our critical ratio guides us to lean towards ordering an amount closer to where our expected profits balance out the costs, as indicated by the CR's aiming point in our probability distribution.

If we were to directly apply this to our simplistic model:
- There isn't a smooth distribution to find an exact match for the CR; instead, we make a judgement call based on the demand occurrences (0 or 2).
- Since our CR (approx 0.6364) reflects more tolerance for the risk of overage (ordering too many) than for underage (ordering too few) due to the higher cost of missing out on sales (Cu), we might be inclined towards ordering a quantity that aligns more closely with observed demand, particularly given our limited dataset.

Given the binary nature of the provided demand data and the critical ratio calculated, a mechanic adjustment holding to strict adherence to the model's calculation against a detailed demand distribution isn't directly applicable. However, theory would suggest leaning towards the order quantity that matches the higher end of our observed demand, aiming to maximize expected profits over expected costs, particularly in such a limited dataset scenario.

In summary, since we are looking for a single quantity number with the understanding that the newsboy problem's outcomes are best applied against more granular demand distributions:

2,5,"[(3, 3), (1, 1)]",3.675940405,4.884284435,17,3,3,"Let's approach this step by step, following the *newsvendor (or newsboy) model* logic, which aims to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes expected profit when facing uncertain demand. The model balances the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too few (underage cost). Here, the selling price is given as $11, and the overage cost is $4. However, the buyback cost or salvage value isn't provided, which often acts as a deduction from the overage cost if unsold items can be returned or repurposed. Without it, we'll assume any unsold items are a complete loss of their production/order cost ($4). The underage cost, or the cost of underordering, is the missed profit opportunity per item not ordered, which would be the selling price minus the ordering cost.

Calculating underage and overage costs:
- Selling price per item (p) = $11
- Cost per item (c) = $4
- Overage cost per item (Co) = c = $4 (since unsold items are a loss)
- Underage cost per item (Cu) = p - c = $11 - $4 = $7

The next step in the newsboy model is to determine the optimal service level, which balances these costs. The optimal service level (Critical Ratio, CR) is the fraction of time demand is met without stockout, calculated as Cu / (Cu + Co).

\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

This critical ratio tells us the optimal probability of not facing a stockout. To apply this to our order quantity decision, we need to relate it to our demand distribution. Since we have limited data, let's consider our two data points as indicative of potential demand scenarios: 1 and 3 units.

If we assume these scenarios are equally likely (given no other information), the demand could be 1 or 3 with a probability of 0.5 each. However, this simplistic approach wouldn't directly apply the CR to deduce an optimal ordering quantity with such a small sample. Instead, in a real-world scenario, one would look at a broader range of historical data to estimate the probability distribution of demand more accurately.

Since our objective is to make an educated decision based on the given data, let's explore a hypothetical distribution that could align closer with our CR. For a more nuanced interpretation, with demand possibilities of 1 and 3:
- Assigning a 50-50 probability to these demands was our initial, straightforward approach, but it doesn't reflect the critical ratio directly. 
- For a decision, given the CR suggests satisfying demand about 63.6% of the time without overstocking, we look for a demand figure that would closely match our need to not exceed inventory in approximately 63.6% of cases.

Given the very limited data and direct application of CR to it being impractical without making further assumptions on demand distribution, we'd typically aim for a solution that, in a broader dataset, reflects a probability of demand being met or exceeded 63.6% of the time.

However, if we were to simplify to a decision for the next day based on the CR and considering a desire not to overstock while also aiming to meet probable demand, we might lean towards ordering a quantity closer to 2 or 3, given our incredibly limited dataset suggests these are the demands we've experienced.

Without a clear probability distribution function for demand, any specific numerical decision will be highly tentative. But aiming towards the goal of the newsboy model with the CR suggests ordering up to the point where we believe we can meet or exceed actual demand in about 63.6% of cases.

Given the simplistic nature of our data and analysis:

2,6,"[(8, 5), (6, 3)]",4.176266947,7.607033118,5,5,*,"To determine the optimal order quantity according to the newsvendor or ""newsboy"" model, we need to carefully analyze the provided data and apply the model's formula. The newsvendor model helps in finding the optimal balance between ordering too much or too little, considering the costs of overage (ordering cost) and underage (lost sales). Here's a step-by-step reasoning process based on the given data:

- **Step 1: Define the parameters**:
  - The given data points are [(8, 5), (6, 3)]. Each tuple represents an (order quantity, observed demand) for each day.
  - Selling price per unit: $11
  - Overage cost (ordering cost) per unit: $4
  - Underage cost per unit (Cu) can be calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Nonetheless, the cost price isn't directly given here. But for this model to work, we need just the selling price and the overage cost for now.
  
- **Step 2: Understand and calculate the critical ratio (Cr)**:
  - The critical ratio is given by \(Cr = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\), where \(Cu\) is the underage cost per unit, and \(Co\) is the overage cost per unit.
  - Here, without the cost price to determine \(Cu\), we'll assume \(Cu\) as the selling price minus the overage cost since if you order one less unit than needed, you essentially lose the profit on that unit (which would be the selling price minus the cost to buy it, but here we'll consider it as selling price - overage cost for simplicity, assuming the cost to buy is somewhat accounted for in the overage cost). Therefore, \(Cu = $11 - $4 = $7\).
  - Hence, the critical ratio \(Cr = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\).

- **Step 3: Apply the critical ratio to demand data**:
  - With the critical ratio, the next step is to use it to estimate the optimal order quantity based on demand distribution. However, the detailed demand distribution is not directly given beyond the two observations. With such limited data, exact demand probabilities are hard to calculate directly. In more comprehensive scenarios, the critical ratio would help us determine the demand level we should meet without exceeding to minimize expected total costs.

- **Step 4: Simplified approach for optimal order quantity**:
  - Given the simplicity of our data, we can't apply complex probability distributions but we can infer some basics. The observed demands were 5 and 3 respectively, with order quantities of 8 and 6.
  - With limited observations, one might consider the average demand as a simple forecast estimate for the next day. Average demand = \(\frac{5 + 3}{2} = 4\). 

- **Step 5: Decision and Conclusion**:
  - Ideally, with more extensive data, we would use the critical ratio and known distribution of demand to determine precisely how much to order. Here, our primary guide would be the critical ratio calculated alongside past demand. The aim would be to adjust our order quantity so that the probability of selling everything ordered is equal to our critical ratio.
  - Given the very simplistic approach due to data limitation, a precise newsvendor model application isn't feasible. Yet, aligning with a conservative approach based on limited data, the average demand observed might serve as a cautious estimate for the next order. Thus, considering both the critical ratio and the attempt to minimize losses without further demand data, an optimal order quantity could align with observed average demand or slightly adjusted based on critical ratio insights and risk strategy.

Considering the limitations and the intent to minimize overage and underage costs with a very rudimentary application of the critical ratio to the limited data at hand, one might incline towards ordering close to the average demand observed or marginally higher considering the critical ratio's implication for a bit more risk-taking.

2,7,"[(26, 3), (17, 4)]",4.31311631,18.77721331,4,4,4,"Let's apply the newsboy (or newsvendor) model step by step to find the optimal order quantity for the next day based on the provided historical data. The newsboy model is designed to help us balance the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) with the cost of ordering too few (the opportunity cost or the lost profit from not meeting demand).

The newsboy model formula for finding the optimal service level (i.e., the probability of not running out of stock) is:
\[ C_r / (C_r + C_o) \]

Where \(C_r\) is the cost of underordering (the cost of lost sales, essentially the selling price minus the cost) and \(C_o\) is the overage cost (the cost of ordering too much, which in this case is the ordering cost).

Given:
- Selling price per item (\(P\)) = $11
- Overage cost per item (\(C_o\)) = $4

We need to derive the cost of underordering (\(C_r\)), which is the difference between the selling price and the cost of ordering:
\[ C_r = P - C_o = 11 - 4 = $7 \]

Now plug these values into the optimal service level formula:
\[ C_r / (C_r + C_o) = 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11 \]

This tells us the service level should be \(7 / 11\) or approximately 0.63636. This means that our ordering strategy should aim to meet demand 63.636% of the time.

Since the newsboy model's critical aspect is calculating this optimal service level, next, we would typically look for a way to translate this service level into an order quantity. However, the newsboy model usually requires knowledge of the demand distribution, such as its mean and standard deviation, which hasn't been directly provided here.

From the given tuples, we have historical order quantities and demands for two days:
1. Ordered 26, demand was 3.
2. Ordered 17, demand was 4.

These tuples themselves do not directly tell us about the demand distribution, but typically, one would use historical demand to estimate the future demand distribution. Since we cannot accurately compute a distribution from two data points, and for the sake of giving you a precise answer, we'll simplify by indicating that more complex statistical analysis would normally be used here to predict future demand based on historical data.

To calculate an approximate 'optimal order quantity' based solely on the given data, one might contemplate the average demand observed (which is not strictly in line with the newsboy model but gives us a simplistic standpoint due to data limitations). The average demand from the provided tuples is \((3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5\).

To align with the traditional approach of the newsboy model, which requires a demand distribution to calculate precisely the optimal order quantity, we recognize that we're working with a simplified assumption due to data constraints.

Since we cannot apply the model precisely as it's supposed to, let's provide a notion based on the service level and the very simplistic overview of demand:

Given the limited data, a precise optimal order quantity is challenging to delineate. For educational purposes, if we were to use the service level calculation and our simplistic demand assessment, businesses often aim to adjust their order quantity based on service level projections. However, without further demand distribution data, a 'safe' order might hover slightly above average demand observed but should ideally be calculated based on a fuller understanding of demand probabilities.

To directly follow instructions and provide a single number for next day's order quantity with the awareness of the model's limitations given current data:
\[ \text{Optimal order quantity for the next day} = \text{Average observed demand} = 3.5 \]

Since we must supply a single integer as the order quantity and ordering half an item isn't practical, we would round this to the closest whole number. Considering both the model's aim to avoid understocking (and thus, to meet or slightly exceed the service level) and the limited data, we might round up to 4 to slightly overcompensate for potential demand underestimation.

The newsboy model is designed to minimize the risk of overstocking while also minimizing the cost of understocking. The formula to determine the optimal order quantity in such scenarios involves understanding the customer demand and balancing the costs of overordering (overage cost) and underordering (underage cost).

Given data:

1. Historical demand and order data: [(5, 5), (3, 3)]
2. Selling price per unit: $11
3. Ordering (overage) cost per unsold unit: $4

Let's identify the underage cost first, which is the lost profit for each unit not ordered that could have been sold. The underage cost (Cu) is the selling price minus the cost of ordering one unit.

- Cu = Selling price - Cost per unit = $11 - $4 = $7

The newsboy model calculates the optimal service level (i.e., the probability of selling all units ordered) using the formula:

\[ P = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the optimal service level,
- \( Cu \) is the underage cost,
- \( Co \) is the overage cost.

From the data:
- Cu = $7
- Co = $4

\[ P = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

This optimal service level suggests that we should aim to order enough stock to meet demand 63.6% of the time.

Given that the historical demand data points are (5, 5) and (3, 3), we have a very limited dataset to project future demand. However, to follow the instructions and use this data to deduce the optimal order quantity:

1. We can calculate the probability distribution of demand based on historical data. Demand has been 5 units 50% of the time and 3 units 50% of the time.
2. With such limited data, it's a bit challenging to directly apply the optimal service level to deduce a specific order quantity for the next day accurately. Normally, for a larger dataset, we'd use the distribution of demand to find the demand level that corresponds to the cumulative probability closest to the calculated service level (in this case, 63.6%).

Given the above and considering the simplicity of the example, optimal ordering quantity might not be directly derivable from the information provided without making assumptions. However, our goal with the given model and data would be to choose an order quantity that closely matches the demand we've observed while considering the optimal service level.

Since our dataset is very limited and shows a 100% sell-through at both 5 and 3 units, and if we were to lean on the calculated service level without over-complicating the analysis:

- The optimal order quantity should be one that matches our historic demand closely while acknowledging the calculated service level. However, the practical application of this model would typically require a more extensive dataset to accurately predict future demand and apply the service level concept more precisely.

Given only two data points, a simple approach might involve ordering a quantity that matches the average of the demands observed, adjusted possibly by understanding the calculated service level. But since both demands have been fully met, and without over-analyzing, one could simply choose the higher demand level observed, given the complete lack of unsold inventory in both instances, which is somewhat aligned with the service level approach but not strictly applying it due to the data limitation.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory model, is a way to determine the optimal order quantity when dealing with perishable goods or items with a limited selling period, where the demand is uncertain. The goal is to find a balance between the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too little (underage cost), to maximize profit.

- Selling price per unit (\(p\)) = 11
- Cost per unit (\(c\)) = 4
- Therefore, the underage cost (\(Cu\)) = selling price (\(p\)) - cost (\(c\)) = \(11 - 4 = 7\)
- Overage cost (\(Co\)) = cost (\(c\)) = 4

### Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio (CR) is crucial for finding the optimal order quantity in the newsboy model. It's the ratio of the underage cost (\(Cu\)) to the sum of the underage and overage costs (\(Cu + Co\)).

\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} = 0.6364 \]

### Step 3: Analyze Demand Data
The provided historical order and demand data are: [(28, 7), (25, 2)]. However, for the newsboy model, we need to focus on the demand side to deduce the demand probability distribution or at least get an estimate of the demand's behavior.

### Step 4: Estimate Demand Probability
Given the limited data points, it's challenging to derive a precise demand distribution. But let's attempt to deduce a pattern or make a simplified estimation:

- From the data, we have two observations of demand: 7 and 2. While this is insufficient for a comprehensive statistical analysis, for demonstration purposes, we could attempt to establish a range or calculate the average demand. However, in reality, one would need more data points to do this accurately.

### Step 5: Apply the Critical Ratio (CR) to Demand
Ideally, you would use the CR to find where it fits within your demand probability distribution to determine the optimal order quantity. Given our lack of detailed probability data, this step will require some estimation or simplification based on understanding demand patterns.

### Concluding with the Optimal Order Quantity:
Given the extreme simplification due to the lack of data, one might consider an average demand or a range where the CR could guide the decision. However, in practice, you would apply the CR to a detailed demand distribution curve to find the exact demand value correlating to the CR, which would then be your optimal order quantity. Given the tutorial nature of this explanation with highly simplified data, the next step of applying the CR to detailed demand estimation is abstracted.

For illustration, if we were to take an overly simplistic approach considering only the average demand from the provided data points (which is not how the model should typically be applied due to oversimplification), the average demand would be \(\frac{7 + 2}{2} = 4.5\). This isn't a direct application of the CR, but aims to show the need for a demand understanding.

Given the limitations of our approach due to data constraints, and the fact that the critical ratio often requires a more detailed demand distribution for precise application, this step should be viewed as illustrative rather than prescriptive.

### Output the Optimal Order Quantity:
For precise application and recommendation, consider refining the demand estimation with more data points and applying the CR to a well-defined demand distribution. Without access to a proper demand distribution or further details, making a recommendation based solely on given calculations and logic is challenging and potentially inaccurate.

2,10,"[(16, 4), (18, 4)]",5.828604785,18.90728988,5,4,8,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we'll follow a structured approach based on the data and costs provided. The newsboy model aims to balance the costs associated with over-ordering (overage cost) and under-ordering (underage cost). The optimal order quantity minimizes the expected cost or maximizes the expected profit.

1. **Identify Cost Parameters**:
   - Selling Price per unit (\(p\)) = $11
   - Overage Cost per unit (\(c\)) = $4
   Since no specific underordering (shortage cost) is mentioned, we infer it as the difference between the selling price and the ordering cost = \(p - c = 11 - 4 = $7\).

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio**:
   The critical ratio (CR) is calculated as the ratio of the underage cost (\(p - c\)) to the total of the underage and overage costs (\(p - c + c\)), which simplifies to the ratio of the underage cost to the selling price. Thus,
   \[CR = \frac{p - c}{p} = \frac{7}{11}\].

3. **Analyze Historical Data for Demand Distribution**:
   The provided data points are [(16, 4), (18, 4)], indicating each day's order quantity and the actual demand. This dataset is too small to accurately determine a demand distribution but we will proceed with these data points for the exercise.

4. **Determine Demand Probabilities**:
   From the provided dataset, it is difficult to establish a clear probability distribution for the demand. However, for demonstration purposes and to proceed with the model, let's focus on understanding the model's application rather than accurately calculating these probabilities given limited data.

5. **Find the Optimal Order Quantity (Q)**:
   In a more comprehensive scenario, we would calculate the probability of demand being less than or equal to various order quantities and find the one closest to the critical ratio. Since our data is limited and not conducive to forming a discrete demand distribution, we'll outline the typical process:
   - Establish a range of potential demand values.
   - Calculate the probability of demand being less than or equal to each value in this range (cumulative probability).
   - Identify the point where the cumulative probability is as close as possible to the CR.

6. **Applying the Concept with Limited Data**:
   Given the extremely limited dataset and its nature (which does not allow us to form a comprehensive distribution), deducing the ""optimal"" order quantity precisely as per newsboy model standards is challenging without making further assumptions.

However, based on our understanding and the critical ratio, if we were to predict or choose the order quantity in a real-world setting with more comprehensive data, we'd align the optimal order quantity where the probability of demand being satisfied (or slightly exceeded) aligns closely with the CR value calculated (0.636).

Given that demand is consistently at 4 units in our limited dataset and the critical ratio suggests that we aim to not significantly overstock relative to our chance of selling, we might lean towards ordering just enough to meet likely demand. However, without more detailed demand probabilities, suggesting an optimal order more accurately is speculative. 

For academic purposes or following the spirit of the exercise with significant assumptions, considering the uniform observed demand and without explicit demand probability calculation, a conservative approach given the costs and selling price might suggest ordering close to observed demand, slightly adjusting for potential variability if more data supported such variability.

**Given only the provided data and the objective to apply the newsboy model's rationale:**

18"
2,11,"[(5, 2), (6, 6)]",5.487542237,6.860725629,6,6,*,"To determine the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy (newsvendor) model, let's follow the given steps, using the provided historical order and demand data:

### 1. Understand the Model Parameters
- **Selling Price per Unit (\(p\))**: $11
- **Cost per Unit Ordered (\(c\))**: $4
- **Overage Cost per Unit (\(Co\))**: This is the loss incurred from ordering one unit too many, calculated as \(c\).
- **Underage Cost per Unit (\(Cu\))**: This is the opportunity cost of ordering one unit too few, calculated as \(p - c\).

Given that:
- \(p = 11\)
- \(c = 4\)

We can compute:
- \(Co = 4\)
- \(Cu = 11 - 4 = 7\)

### 2. Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio is the ratio of the underage cost to the total cost of a misjudgment, which is the sum of the underage and overage costs.

\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4}\]

Perform the calculation:

\[CR = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\]

### 3. Determine the Optimal Service Level
This step requires us to find the service level (\(SL\)) that matches or is closest to the critical ratio. However, with limited data, we directly leverage the critical ratio to aim for the probability that demand will not exceed our order quantity.

### 4. Analyze the Provided Data
Given data: \([(5, 2), (6, 6)]\)
- Day 1: Ordered 5, demand was 2.
- Day 2: Ordered 6, demand was 6.

From this small sample, we have seen two demand levels: 2 and 6 units. There's no explicit probability distribution given, but we can assume that the demand can vary, and potentially, the demand distribution could be estimated with more data.

### 5. Approximate the Optimal Order Quantity
Without a clear demand distribution, moving directly towards finding an exact optimal order quantity is challenging. However, the critical ratio suggests we should aim for a stock level that meets demand about 63.64% of the time.

Given the very limited sample:
- With demand observed at 2 and 6, there's an indication that demand can vary widely.
- Without explicit probabilities for demand levels, estimating an optimal order quantity involves speculation based on available data.

### Conclusion
Considering the limited data and the CR, an optimal order quantity would ideally be one where the estimated probability of selling the stock matches the CR.

Since we observed demands of 2 and 6, and our goal is to meet the demand at roughly 63.64% level, and given the absence of a more precise demand distribution, an intuitive approach would suggest considering an order quantity closer to, but not exceeding, the higher observed demand to aim for the CR threshold.

Thus, while an exact figure is hard to ascertain with such limited data, a safe yet potentially optimal quantity, leaning on the conservative interpretation of our CR and observed demands, might lie between the two observed demands. Given the intent to not overstock according to the CR, and taking a simple average or leaning towards higher observed demand might suggest an order quantity slightly above the higher demand observed, to account for potential unseen higher demands but keeping an eye on not overordering due to the costs involved.

Given the constraints and aim for a CR-matched ordering strategy, a slightly cautious approach around or just above the highest observed demand of 6 could be reasoned. Since we need a single number as the output for the optimal order:

**6**"
2,12,"[(16, 7), (8, 6)]",7.755221165,11.61095442,7,7,7,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model (also known as the newsvendor model), we need to analyze the provided data. The model helps balance the costs between ordering too much (overage) and not ordering enough (underage) by finding the order quantity that maximizes expected profit or minimizes expected costs.

Here's our step-by-step reasoning process based on the provided data and costs:

1. **Understand the Provided Data**: 
    - We have two tuples representing the order quantity and observed demand for each day: (16, 7) and (8, 6). 
    - Selling price per unit is $11.
    - Ordering (overage) cost per unsold unit is $4.

2. **Determine the Underage Cost (Cu)**: 
    - The underage cost is the lost profit for every unit not stocked but had a demand. This is the selling price minus the cost per unit since weâ€™re not given a separate purchase cost, the only explicit cost is the overage cost ($4); thus, it's implied the item's cost is internal to the selling price. Therefore, the underage cost is $11 - $4 = $7 per unit.

3. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**: 
    - The critical ratio is calculated as \(CR = Cu / (Cu + Co)\), where Cu is the underage cost, and Co is the overage cost.
    - Here, \(CR = 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11 = 0.6364\).

4. **Estimate the Demand Distribution**:
    - From the provided data, we have observed demands of 7 and 6. However, with such limited data, accurately determining a demand distribution is challenging. We'll proceed by considering these points as indicative of our demand range and infer a simplistic distribution from them.

5. **Determining Optimal Order Quantity Based on CR**:
    - In a precise implementation, we would integrate the CR with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand to identify the optimal order quantity q, where P(Demand â‰?q) = CR. However, with the limited data provided, this step will be more conceptual.
    - If we had a more detailed demand distribution, we'd look for the point where the probability of demand being less than or equal to our order quantity matches our CR (0.6364).

With the simplified approach due to data constraints, making a grounded recommendation for the optimal order quantity is less about precise calculation and more about aligning with the logic of the newsboy model. Although our data is minimal, an optimal order quantity would notionally align with observed demand trends, slightly adjusted upwards to match the CR, indicating we should stock more when the penalty for understocking (losing sales) is higher compared to overstocking costs.

However, given the limited dataâ€”just two observationsâ€”it's risky to suggest a significant deviation from observed demands. A safe interim approach might center the order quantity around the observed demands (7 and 6) while considering the understocking cost encouraging a slightly higher quantity.

Based on the presented reasoning process:

7"
2,13,"[(8, 8), (3, 3)]",8.722157258,4.718468007,26,8,*,"To find the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy model (also known as the newsvendor model), let's go step by step:

1. **Understand the Model**: The newsboy model helps us to decide on the optimal inventory level to order for a product that has uncertain demand. The goal is to find a balance where the cost of ordering too many (and potentially having leftovers) and ordering too few (and missing out on sales) is minimized.

2. **Identify Given Data**:
   - Historical order and demand data: [(8, 8), (3, 3)]
   - Selling price per unit: $11
   - Ordering cost (overage cost) per unit: $4
   - The selling price is higher than the ordering cost, which is typical for such problems.

3. **Calculate the Critical Ratio**:
   The critical ratio (CR) is given by \(\frac{Selling\ Price - Cost}{Selling\ Price}\), which calculates the proportion of demand we are aiming to satisfy without overstocking.

   \[\text{CR} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11}\]

4. **Compile Demand Data**:
   From the tuples [(8, 8), (3, 3)], it seems like the orders were exactly meeting demand, which doesn't directly help in understanding the variability in demand. However, for the sake of this model, we do know that demand can at least reach up to 8 units.

5. **Estimate Demand Distribution**:
   Given the limited data, it's challenging to accurately estimate the demand distribution. Ideally, we would use more data points to understand the distribution of demand. For the sake of this example, let's proceed with the data we have, where the demand exactly met the supply.

6. **Determine Optimal Order Quantity**:
   Since we don't have a clear demand distribution, we would typically look for the percentile of the demand distribution that corresponds to the critical ratio. However, given our very limited dataset and its nature, we'll consider that the demand could potentially be the higher number we've seen, 8, considering that our sample size is very small and does not provide variability.

7. **Conclusion**:
   Given the simplicity of the example and the matching order and demand figures provided, a more nuanced analysis requiring a larger dataset and variability in demand isn't possible here. Therefore, basing our decision on the data available and knowing that we aim to optimize against having too much overage or underage, we might consider ordering up to the higher demand level we've seen, which is 8.

However, it's important to note that this solution is crafted with the understanding that a proper statistical analysis of demand distribution is needed for a more accurate prediction according to the newsvendor model principles.

**Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day: 8**"
2,14,"[(13, 8), (6, 6)]",7.652201001,9.97190886,10,8,8,"To deduce the optimal order quantity using the Newsboy Model with the provided historical order and demand data, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Given Data
- The data provided shows pairs of numbers where the first number of each pair is the order quantity and the second is the observed demand for each day.
- Provided tuples: [(13, 8), (6, 6)]

### Step 2: Define Key Variables
- Selling price (\(P\)) = $11
- Ordering cost or overage cost (\(C\)) = $4
- Underage cost (\(Cu\)) = \(P - C\) = $11 - $4 = $7
- The probability of demand (\(Pr\)) needs to be calculated based on historical data.

### Step 3: Calculate Demand Probabilities
First, we need to derive the probability distribution of demand from the historical data. However, the provided sample is minimal, but we'll proceed with what we have:
- Observed demands: 8 (once) and 6 (once)
- Total observations: 2

From this, we can say there are two distinct demand levels observed, 6 and 8.

### Step 4: Calculate the Critical Ratio (\(CR\))
The critical ratio is calculated as the underage cost (\(Cu\)) divided by the sum of underage and overage costs (\(Cu + Co\)), where \(Co\) is the unit cost of overordering.
\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \]

\[ CR â‰?0.636 \]

### Step 5: Using the Demand Probabilities to Determine Optimal Order Quantity
Given the extremely limited data and its discrete nature, the ""optimal"" order quantity (Q) is more nuanced. The critical ratio helps us determine the probability at or below which we should set our stock.

Since we don't have a continuous distribution or a larger dataset to work with, we'll work with our demand levels directly. With demands at 6 and 8 and each having occurred once in our small dataset, we're looking for where the cumulative probability of demand falls around or just below 0.636. With only two data points:
- The probability for demand â‰?6: 0.5
- The probability for demand > 6 and â‰?8: 1.0

### Step 6: Making the Decision
Given the CR of 0.636, the optimal ordering quantity should be the lowest quantity where the cumulative probability is just above or equals to 0.636. Based on our limited dataset:
- The demand of 6 fits just below the CR.
- The demand of 8 far exceeds the CR but is the next available demand point.

Since a CR of 0.636 indicates we should stock an amount that will meet or exceed demand with a probability of around 63.6%, and based on our simplistic model with a lack of granularity in demand probabilities, the closest demand point that meets this in our dataset is 8.

### Conclusion

2,15,"[(11, 0), (12, 8)]",2.943491396,11.49125332,5,8,.,"To apply the **newsboy model** (also known as the ***newsvendor model***) to determine the optimal order quantity, we first need to understand the basic components of this model. The newsboy model is used to find the optimal inventory level that minimizes costs or maximizes profits when facing uncertain demand. The key elements here include:

1. **Selling price per unit** (\(p\)): \$11
2. **Cost per unit ordered** (\(c\)): Not directly given but is essential for calculating the cost of overordering (overage cost).
3. **Overage cost** per unit (\(Co\)): \$4 (This is the cost of ordering one unit too many, which equals the cost per unit minus the salvage value per unit. If no salvage value is provided, it is the cost of the item. However, without the direct ordering cost \(c\), we infer \(Co = c - salvage\), but since \(salvage\) value is not provided and we're told it's the ordering cost, we proceed with it as provided.)
4. **Underage cost** per unit (\(Cu\)): This is the cost of ordering one unit too few, which equals the selling price minus the cost per unit (profit lost per unit not sold). Since we're not provided with the cost \(c\), we'll calculate \(Cu\) as \(p - c\). But since \(c\) is not directly provided, and we actually need \(Cu\) for our calculation, let's consider another approach to find it, using overage cost and the context provided.

Given the data is insufficient to directly calculate \(Cu\) (since we don't have \(c\)), we need to adjust our approach based on what is provided and the context. Usually, \(Cu = p - c\). However, we are going to focus on the elements we have, notably using \(Co\) and \(p\) to deduce the optimal order quantity, acknowledging a missing piece in the direct cost calculation.

Considering the newsboy formula for the optimal service level (\(CSL\)):

\[CSL = \frac{Cu}{Cu+Co}\]

We can substitute the selling price \(p\) for \(Cu\) in a simplified approach since \(Cu\) broadly represents the lost profit on not selling a unit (assuming \(Cu = p - c\) and \(c\) is not directly given for calculation).

Let's first consider if we can infer \(Cu\) differently or proceed with the next steps of the model using the given \(Co\) and \(p\).

1. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR):** It represents the probability of selling an item versus not selling it, calculated using \(Cu\) and \(Co\). Given \(Co = 4\) and assuming \(Cu = p - c\), yet \(c\) remains undefined herein for direct calculation.

2. **Use Demand Data for Probability Estimation:** From the tuples provided \([(11, 0), (12, 8)]\), there's not enough data to accurately represent a demand distribution directly for calculating CR or the optimal service level without making assumptions. However, if considering this as illustrative data suggesting demand variability, the next steps would typically involve calculating demand probabilities and expected overage/underage scenarios based on order quantities.

Given the constraint in realistic computation from the information provided (specifically, the lack of an explicit cost \(c\) or more comprehensive demand data), let's focus on an intuitive approach:

To facilitate an illustrative example, assuming we consider \(Cu\) as \(p\) (given to showcase calculation without direct cost \(c\)), the \(CSL\) would be not accurately calculable with the provided information directly. Therefore, we are at a juncture where we're considering hypothetical reasoning in absence of direct inputs for \(Cu\) and comprehensive demand representation.

However, to move towards providing an output and fostering an educational guess in line with the request for the next optimal order quantity:

If we were to use just the provided data in a simplified manner, analyzing demand vs. order quantity could hint towards adjusting order closer to observed demand when known, yet this contradicts the depth of analysis required for a newsboy model application, especially in calculating optimal order quantities with precision.

Given the constraints and focus on providing an educational guess in the absence of comprehensive data or direct \(Cu\) calculation:

Considering the goal to output the next optimal order quantity with an understanding that the provided data and information constrain detailed calculation:

Without a sufficient basis for calculating \(Cu\), the actual optimal quantity via the newsboy model formula is not directly calculable. However, in the real application of this model, one would utilize historical demand distribution, calculate the critical service level (CSL), and then decide on the optimal quantity based on the CSL and the distribution of demand.

**Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day: [Inferred Decision Based on Provided Information]**

Given the limitations and the aim to provide a numerical answer as requested:

Let's use the average demand from provided data as a simplistic approach (even though it's not the newsboy model's typical method), which is \((0 + 8) / 2 = 4\).

Without a definitive method to accurately calculate due to provided constraints and to offer a decision-based on question construction:

The final line explicitly requests only the optimal order quantity as a number. Given the constraints and incomplete data for a precise calculation based on the newsboy model, an exact number isn't provided in the explanation. The actual application of this model requires complete data on costs, potential profits, and a distribution of demand to calculate accurately."
2,16,"[(12, 10), (6, 6)]",6.566775653,10.17442585,12,10,.,"Let's use the Newsvendor model to deduce the optimal order quantity based on the provided data. The Newsvendor (or newsboy) model is a mathematical model used for inventory management in situations where demand is uncertain. It aims to balance the costs of ordering too many items (overage cost) and not ordering enough items to meet demand (underage cost). The formula for the optimal order quantity in this model is given by:

\[Q^* = F^{-1}\left(\frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\right)\]

Where:
- \(Q^*\) is the optimal order quantity.
- \(F^{-1}\)\(\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand.
- \(Cu\) is the underage cost, which is the cost of underestimating demand (the lost profit per unit of demand not satisfied).
- \(Co\) is the overage cost, which is the cost of overestimating demand (the cost of ordering a unit that is not sold).

Given in the problem:
- Selling price = 11
- Ordering cost (overage cost, \(Co\)) = 4
- There's no direct information on the purchase cost, but we can infer underage cost \(Cu\) as the difference between the selling price and the purchase cost. However, the purchase cost is not given here directly; typically, \(Cu = Selling Price - Purchase Cost\). In our scenario, we will need to deduce the underage cost differently since we lack specific cost details.

### Step 1: Calculating the Underage Cost
To proceed with the newsboy model, typically, we need the underage cost, which would normally be the profit per unit for each unit sold that exceeds the ordered amount. Unfortunately, without knowing the purchase cost directly, we can only assert that \(Cu = Selling Price - Purchase Cost\). Nonetheless, for the Newsvendor model, what's crucial is the comparison or ratio of \(Cu\) to \(Co\).

### Step 2: Demand Data Analysis
Let's analyze the provided demand data to estimate the demand distribution. We have two data points: (12, 10) and (6, 6), where the first number in each tuple is the order quantity and the second is the observed demand.

From these tuples, it's not straightforward to derive a full demand distribution due to the limited data, but they do give us some information about demand levels.

### Step 3: Estimation and Calculation
Since we lack detailed demand distribution data and specific cost parameters beyond the overage cost (\(Co = 4\)) and selling price, the direct application of the Newsvendor formula is limited. Instead, let's discuss a general approach using available data:

1. **Determine the Demand Probability Distribution**: In a typical scenario, this is derived from historical demand data. With only two observations, this is not feasible directly, but in practice, one would use more extensive historical data to fit a distribution (e.g., normal, Poisson).

2. **Calculate Critical Ratio (\(Cu/(Cu+Co)\))**: This involves determining the underage cost and using it alongside the known overage cost.

    - Given the lack of data for exact calculation, a practical approach is needed for estimating or deducing \(Cu\) based on provided or similar scenarios. For this step-by-step overview, let's acknowledge that the calculation of \(Cu\) would ideally be based on the difference between the selling price and the purchase cost, influencing the critical ratio.

### Conclusion
Given the constraints and the limited data provided, we cannot mathematically calculate the exact optimal order quantity without making several assumptions, especially regarding the distribution of demand and the precise calculation of \(Cu\).

However, in practice, a retailer would estimate the demand distribution from a larger dataset, calculate the critical ratio using precise \(Cu\) and \(Co\), and then determine \(Q^*\) from the demand's cumulative distribution function.

For an educational guess in this simplified scenario, with missing critical information and assuming \(Cu\) and demand distribution cannot be directly calculated or estimated from the provided data, the focus would be on balancing the known overage cost with the anticipated profit per unit.

Given the constraints of this explanation, I'll conclude with a reminder:

To precisely apply the Newsvendor model, one needs comprehensive demand data and clear understanding of both overage and underage costs. Real-life applications often involve detailed statistical analysis and more complete datasets.

Without further necessary details, we cannot accurately compute the optimal order quantity; any specific number provided would be speculative and not grounded in the Newsvendor model's principles.

However, the purpose here was to illuminate the thought process behind using the Newsvendor model, emphasizing the importance of understanding the costs and demand distribution in inventory decision-making."
2,17,"[(16, 8), (14, 6)]",9.224755066,18.41432564,8,8,8,"To utilize the newsboy model (also known as the newsvendor model) for finding the optimal order quantity based on the given historical data, let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand the Model**: The newsboy model aims to find the order quantity that maximizes profit when facing uncertain demand. The key balance is between the overage cost (the cost when you order more than the demand, which in this case is the ordering cost of 4) and the underage cost (the cost when demand exceeds the order quantity, essentially the missed profit per unit, which is the selling price minus the ordering cost, i.e., 11 - 4 = 7).

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**: The CR is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs, which helps in determining the service level or the optimal in-stock probability. Using the costs:
   \[
   CR = \frac{Underage\ Cost}{Underage\ Cost + Overage\ Cost} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives us:
   \[
   CR = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364
   \]

3. **Analyze the Demand Data**: With the demand data provided as [(16, 8), (14, 6)], we see the demand levels observed were 8 and 6. From the data given, we can infer (or rather, use this as a sample representation) about the likelihood of demand falling below or at these levels.

4. **Estimate The Demand Probability Distribution**: For simplification and due to the small sample size, we will estimate the probability of demands being at or below the historical levels. Unfortunately, with only two data points, this would be rudimentary at best, but let's proceed. We have demands of 6 and 8.

5. **Calculate the Cumulative Probability (F(q))**: Assuming a simple non-continuous distribution or approximating the demand distribution from the limited data:

   - The chance (probability) of demand being 6 or less (P(6 or less)) could be considered as 0.5 (since we have two data points, and one shows a demand below 7).
   - Similarly, the chance (probability) of demand being 8 or less (P(8 or less)) could be inferred as 1 (both data points are 8 or less).

6. **Determine the Optimal Order Quantity**: We aim to find a demand level (q) where F(q) is as close as possible to CR without going under. From our estimated probabilities:
   
   - For demand of 6, F(6) = 0.5.
   - For demand of 8, F(8) = 1.

Given our CR of approximately 0.6364, an optimal order quantity would be a level of demand where the cumulative probability is just above 0.6364. From the crude estimates available (due to limited data), demand of 8 fulfills this condition (being the next level just above our CR).

In practice, you would utilize more comprehensive statistical methods to estimate F(q) more accurately with a larger dataset. Since this is not feasible here, we shall lean on the basic approximation that demand of 8 comes closest to our CR criteria.

Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day, according to the newsboy model and the simplified analysis provided, is:

2,18,"[(13, 9), (13, 6)]",6.658729952,19.15181885,8,9,.,"To solve this problem using the **newsboy model**, we must calculate the optimal order quantity that maximizes profit, considering the balance between having too much inventory (overage cost) and missing potential sales (underage cost). The overage cost is given as the cost of ordering one unit too many, which in this case is $4. The underage cost is the lost profit from not ordering enough, which equals the selling price minus the ordering cost. Here, the selling price is $11, so the underage cost is $11 - $4 = $7.

The newsboy model uses the critical ratio (CR) to determine the optimal service level, where:

\[ CR = \frac{Underage\ Cost}{Underage\ Cost + Overage\ Cost} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

The CR of 0.6364 means the optimal service level is to have enough stock to meet demand 63.64% of the time. Now, we need to analyze the provided demand data to determine what order quantity aligns with this service level.

The historical demand data points are 9 and 6. To apply the CR, we must look at how often demand falls at or below a certain quantity. The probabilities of demand levels, based on the limited dataset, are:

- Demand of 6: 1 out of 2 days (50%)
- Demand of 9: 1 out of 2 days (50%)

Given we have only two data points, interpreting these for the service level means considering the next highest demand level that could potentially match or exceed our CR of 63.64%. Since a demand of 6 results in a 50% cumulative probability and adding the next level of demand (9) would exceed our desired service level, we would choose the order quantity just high enough to meet this CR.

However, the limitation of this dataset means we have to interpolate or approximate the demand quantity that fits a 63.64% service level, given only two data points. The precise demand level corresponding to exactly 63.64% cannot be derived from these two points alone without an assumption or further data. The closest we can say is that the optimal order quantity is likely above 6 and up to or slightly above 9 to aim for the calculated service level, given our discrete steps.

Given the nature of this dataset and the need for a specific answer without interpolation between 6 and 9 (and our CR suggesting we meet demand slightly more than 50% but not 100% of the time), an educated guess within these constraints would be around 9 or slightly above to lean towards the calculated CR.

Given the constraints and the aim of the Newsboy model to choose an order quantity aligning as closely as possible with the calculated CR, while we might want to say 10 to aim closer to the CR with a very limited dataset, a conservative approach with given figures would lean towards ordering what has been observed as peak demand:

\[ \text{Optimal order quantity for the next day} = 9 \]

However, it's important to note that with more comprehensive demand data, a more precise calculation and estimation could be performed."
2,19,"[(7, 4), (11, 2)]",2.528922627,13.60017446,3,4,*,"To determine the optimal order quantity according to the **newsvendor (or newsboy) model**, we first need to understand the basic concept. This model is used to determine the optimal level of inventory to manage demand uncertainty, balancing the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too little (underage cost). The overage cost is the loss from ordering one unit more than the actual demand, while the underage cost is the loss from ordering one unit less than the actual demand.

Given:
- Selling price: $11
- Ordering (overage) cost: $4
- Demand data: [(7, 4), (11, 2)]

### Step 1: Calculate Underage Cost
Underage cost (Cu) is the lost profit for each unit not ordered but demanded, which is the selling price minus the cost per unit.
\[Cu = Selling\ Price - Cost\ = 11 - 4 = 7\]

### Step 2: Calculate Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio (CR) is the proportion of demand you must meet without having too much or too little inventory. It's calculated as:
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\]
where \(Cu\) is the underage cost, and \(Co\) is the overage cost. Substituting the values gives:
\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]
\[CR = 0.6364\]

### Step 3: Demand Distribution
From the provided data, we list the demands and their respective probabilities. But first, let's make sense of the demand data. The tuples represent (order quantity, observed demand), which we interpret as observations (7, 4), (11, 2). 

Assuming the data you provided is all we have to estimate demand, we would calculate probabilities based on these observations. However, with such a small dataset, our probability distribution will be more illustrative than statistically robust.

Given the small dataset:


- Demand 4: Once in 2 days.
- Demand 2: Once in 2 days.

Probabilities:
- P(Demand=2) = 0.5
- P(Demand=4) = 0.5


### Step 4: Determine Optimal Order Quantity
We need to find a demand quantity at which the cumulative probability is just equal to or slightly greater than the critical ratio (0.6364).

With only two data points:
- Cumulative probability for a demand of 2 = 0.5, which is less than CR.
- Cumulative probability for a demand of 4 = 1 (0.5 for demand 2 + 0.5 for demand 4), which exceeds CR.

Given this simplistic view, to match or just exceed the CR (0.6364), the demand probability consideration tells us to order for the next highest demand level where the cumulative probability reaches or exceeds the CR.

### Conclusion
Given our limited illustrative dataset and the straightforward application of the CR, the next optimal order quantity, considering the crucial objective to not substantially exceed the CR (0.6364) but to aim just above it, would align with the next observed demand level of 4 units.

2,20,"[(24, 10), (24, 6)]",9.560439712,16.18948871,9,10,4,"To calculate the optimal order quantity based on the Newsvendor (Newsboy) model, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Newsvendor Model Basics**:
   - This model helps in determining the optimal inventory level to minimize the costs associated with overstocking and understocking, given the uncertain demand.
   - The key formula for the model is: \(Cu / (Cu + Co)\), where
        - \(Cu\) = Cost of understocking per unit = Selling price per unit - Cost per unit
        - \(Co\) = Cost of overstocking per unit = Ordering cost per unit

2. **Determine Costs**:
   - Selling price per unit = $11
   - Ordering cost per unit (overage cost) = $4
   - Since the actual cost per unit is not given, we assume the cost of understocking as \(Cu = Selling price - Cost per unit\). Here, to apply the inherent concept of the Newsvendor model, we need to imply that the cost per unit is purely the ordering (overage) cost in this context, hence \(Cu = 11 - 4 = 7\).

3. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**:
   The critical ratio can be calculated as follows:
   \[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]
   This gives
   \[CR \approx 0.63636\]

4. **Data Analysis for Demand Estimation**:
   - The demand data provided in the tuples [(24, 10), (24, 6)] shows orders and their respective demands.
   - However, the Newsvendor model primarily deals with anticipating demand to decide the optimal order quantity rather than using past order quantities.
   - For this step, assuming we need to estimate demand to find an optimal ordering decision related to the critical ratio, we interpret the demand's behavior but recognize the limitation with only two data points. The demand values are 10 and 6.

5. **Optimal Order Quantity Estimation**:
   - With the Newsvendor model, the optimal order quantity is related to matching the probability of not exceeding the demand with the CR. With only two data points (6 and 10), and lacking a defined distribution, a direct calculation isn't straightforward.
   - In practical applications, more robust statistical methods would be deployed to estimate the demand distribution first.

Given the simplified and illustrative nature of this explanation, without a clear, direct way to apply the critical ratio to the demand distribution due to insufficient data and the omission of a specific cost per unit, we utilize the provided data in a basic form. Typically, the CR informs us of the proportion of time the demand should be below our order quantity.

Since we're not provided with enough information to accurately estimate a demand distribution, and the instruction is to deduce, we reckon the critical ratio is an indicator of our inventory strategy leaning more towards not having understock than overstock. Given the very basic demand insights and the high penalty for understocking (foregone sales), an optimal strategy leans towards ordering closer to the demand upper limit observed if we were to match it against a vague distribution expectation.

However, given the constraints and the illustrative nature of calculating a specific optimal order quantity without detailed demand distribution data, a precise number is challenging to assert. Normally, one would use the CR in conjunction with the demand probability distribution to find the quantity for which the probability of demand being less than or equal to that quantity is around the calculated CR.

Final Step, Conclusion: Considering the limitations in data and the process explained:
- A precise optimal order quantity calculation requires more detailed demand distribution analysis.
- For the next step or day's order, based on the simplified assumption and aiming for a balance suggested by the CR, while we should lean towards the higher demand seen (since our CR suggests aiming not to understock), the exact optimal quantity isn't calculable with high precision given the data.

3,1,"[(27, 10), (15, 2), (13, 6)]",9.157208622,18.35360015,7,6,"
","To find the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we have to understand a few key elements:

1. **Selling Price (\(p\))**: The amount earned per unit sold, which is $11.
2. **Ordering Cost (Overage Cost) (\(c\))**: The cost of ordering (or producing) one more unit, which is $4.
3. **Salvage Value (\(s\))**: Not explicitly mentioned, but typically in newsboy model problems, the salvage value (the amount you earn or save from not selling a unit and having it left over) is lower than both the selling price and the cost. In this case, since it's not provided, it's reasonable to assume it's either 0 or simply not considered, which aligns with the prompt focusing only on selling price and ordering cost.
4. **Critical Ratio (\(CR\))**: This ratio helps determine the optimal service level and is calculated as \(\frac{p - c}{p}\) because we don't have a salvage value, or if assuming \(s = 0\), then it's \(\frac{p - c}{p - s}\).

Now, let's execute the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Critical Ratio (\(CR\))

Given:
- \(p = $11\)
- \(c = $4\)
- \(s = $0\) (Assumed, as it's not given and to simplify the calculation)

\[CR = \frac{p - c}{p - s} = \frac{11 - 4}{11 - 0} = \frac{7}{11}\]

### Step 2: Determine Demand Distribution

From the provided tuples of order quantity and observed demand \((order, demand)\): [(27, 10), (15, 2), (13, 6)], we focus on the demand side to understand the pattern or distribution. However, for the simplicity of the newsboy model calculation, we aspire to find the demand probability distribution or at least get an insight into demand variability. But with such small data, let's proceed directly towards utilizing our \(CR\).

### Step 3: Apply the \(CR\) to Find the Optimal Order Quantity

Normally, we'd use the \(CR\) to find the percentile of the demand distribution that corresponds to it. However, detailed demand probability distribution calculation is complex with limited data, and this model typically requires either historical demand distribution knowledge or a larger sample size to accurately estimate it.

Given the simplicity of the prompt and the model's nature, the objective shifts to align more conceptually: with the given \(CR\), you'd typically look for the demand level that you'd meet or exceed with that probability (\(0.636\), in this case).

#### Without a Defined Distribution:

Without a well-defined demand distribution or further data to calculate the exact demand percentile matching the \(CR\), we proceed conceptually:

1. **Identify Demand Trends**: Look for how often the actual demand was close to or exceeded by the order quantity in provided data to project a rough estimate. This estimation leans on understanding that with a \(CR\) of \(0.636\), we are aiming to satisfy approximately 63.6% of the potential demand scenarios.

2. **Adjust Based on \(CR\)**: Considering we aim to cater to that \% of demand faithfully without incurring too much overage or underage costs.

#### Decision:

Given the simplifications and lack of detailed demand distribution, a direct calculation towards a specific optimal quantity isn't straightforward. Instead, the strategy involves balancing between avoiding too much excess (since overage cost is $4 per unit) and aiming to meet the demand to maximize revenue. The provided data points are limited and show significant variability, making precise calculation challenging without further assumptions.

However, to follow through conceptually with the available information and understanding the intent to optimize inventory:

- **Reviewing Historical Demands**: The demands were 10, 2, and 6.

These data points are sparse but suggest variability in demand. A more cautious approach, given the higher penalty for overages than the potential loss from underordering (since the penalty is essentially the cost difference), would be to lean slightly above the median demand to capitalize on higher expected sales without incurring significant overage costs.

Given the demands observed are 10, 2, and 6 â€?the median is 6. Adjusting slightly upwards to anticipate some higher demand but not too much to avoid excessive overage costs could be wise.

### Conclusion:

Given the critical ratio, sparse data, and the approach outlined, a conservative yet slightly optimistic adjustment from the median demand value would be prudent. Thus, a suitable next day order quantity, balancing between the guidance from the newsboy model and observed demands, might be a bit above the median to cater to the variability seen. 

Considering the demand distribution and aiming to not overstock based on the critical ratio guidance:

**Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day: 8**

3,2,"[(8, 4), (7, 2), (16, 7)]",4.37919678,12.91508556,5,4,],"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model, also known as the single-period model, we have to consider the trade-off between having too much inventory (overage cost) and not having enough inventory to meet demand (underage cost). The provided data consists of tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day. Let's analyze the data and calculate the optimal order quantity for the next day.

Given:
- Selling price per unit = 11
- Ordering cost per unit (overage cost) = 4
- There's no given cost for not meeting demand (underage cost), but it can be deduced from the information provided. The underage cost would be the lost profit for each unit of unmet demand, which is the selling price minus the ordering cost per unit. Thus, the underage cost = \(11 - 4 = 7\).

The critical ratio (CR) is calculated using the formula:
\[CR = \frac{\text{Underage Cost}}{\text{Underage Cost + Overage Cost}}\]

Plugging in the values:
\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4}\]
\[CR = \frac{7}{11}\]
\[CR = 0.6364\]

The critical ratio represents the optimal service level, which means we should aim to have enough inventory to meet 63.64% of the demand.

Now, to calculate the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model, we need to look at the historical demand data provided and find a demand level that matches or closely matches our CR.

The historical demands are 4, 2, and 7. To determine the optimal order quantity, we can arrange these demands in ascending order: 2, 4, 7.

Since our critical ratio is 0.6364, we want to find a demand level that approximately 63.64% of the demand will not exceed. Given our small sample, we interpolate to find the demand that best represents this percentile.

With only three data points, it's a bit crude, but the demand that best fits being just over 63.64% of the time (closer to the middle in our case) is 4. However, considering we need to be as accurate as possible and based on our available demand observations, a demand of 7 is the highest observed and doing a precise calculation or more nuanced estimation isn't straightforward with such limited data without further statistical techniques.

Given the nature of this problem and aiming for simplicity, we should look at the historical data and lean towards ordering a quantity that has been closest to or above our critical ratio's implication. The data suggests that on days with higher orders, the actual demand was significantly less than the order quantity, indicating potential overage.

Without sophisticated statistical analysis, the best we can do with this data is to estimate based on the provided information and the critical ratio's guidance. However, given the limitations of observational data (only three points), a risk-averse strategy that leans towards the demand observations while considering our CR would be advisable.

In practice, one might use more detailed historical data points or statistical methods to better estimate the demand distribution and thus a more precise ordering quantity. Yet, with the given simplistic scenario, one might err towards a conservative estimate near the higher observed demands, but without exceeding it significantly to minimize overage costs.

Therefore,

3,3,"[(9, 5), (6, 6), (5, 5)]",6.494257932,6.159496935,8,5,*,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy model, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Model**: The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory model, helps in deciding the optimal order quantity to minimize costs related to overstocking and understocking, taking into account that demand varies. If you order too much and don't sell it all (overage), you incur a cost (ordering cost here). If you order too little and demand is high, you miss out on potential profits (underage cost, calculated as selling price minus ordering cost in this model).

2. **Determine Costs**:
    - **Selling Price (P)** = $11
    - **Ordering Cost (C)** = $4
    - **Underage Cost (Cu)** = P - C = $11 - $4 = $7 (The loss of profit per unit for underordering)
    - **Overage Cost (Co)** = C = $4 (The cost per unit for overordering)

3. **Calculate the Cu/(Cu+Co) Ratio**:
    - This ratio helps determine the service level or the probability of meeting demand without stockouts.
    - Cu/(Cu+Co) = $7/($7+$4) = $7/$11 â‰?0.6364

4. **Analyze Demand Data**:
    - The given demand data points are: 5, 6, 5 (extracted from the tuples).
    - To use the newsboy model effectively, it's beneficial to understand the distribution of demand. However, with such limited data, we'll consider these points to find an empirical distribution.

5. **Determine the Probability Distribution of Demand**:
    - Since we only have three data points (5, 6, 5), it's challenging to create an accurate distribution. But we can somewhat gauge that the demand of 5 occurred twice and 6 occurred once.
    - Probability of demand being 5 = 2/3
    - Probability of demand being 6 = 1/3

6. **Find the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Demand**:
    - Our goal is to find at what demand level the CDF is approximately equal to our calculated service level (0.6364).
    - With so few data points, we'll directly state:
        - Probability (Demand â‰?5) = 2/3 or â‰?0.6667
        - Probability (Demand â‰?6) = 1 or 100%

7. **Compare the Service Level to CDF**:
    - We want the optimal order quantity where the CDF is just above or equal to the service level. Here, ordering for a demand of 5 has a CDF (â‰?0.6667) just above our service level (0.6364).

Based on these steps, considering the simplicity of the distribution and our calculations, the optimal order quantity to minimize costs and maximize profit for the next day, given the constraints and the model requirements, seems to align closely with a demand of 5, given our calculated ratio and the empirical probabilities.

3,4,"[(13, 10), (10, 6), (6, 6)]",6.848564441,9.440702248,9,6,0,"To deduce the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the historical order and demand data provided, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Newsboy Model Basics
The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory model, helps determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the cost associated with overstocking and understocking. The critical factors include:

- The cost of overordering (overage cost) per unit, in this case, is the ordering cost of 4.
- The cost of underordering (underage cost) per unit, calculated as the selling price minus the ordering cost, in this case, \(11 - 4 = 7\).
- The probability distribution or pattern of demand.

### Step 2: Calculate Underage and Overage Costs
- Overage Cost, \(C_o\), is 4 (given).
- Underage Cost, \(C_u\), is \(11 - 4 = 7\).

### Step 3: Determine the Optimal Service Level (Critical Ratio)
The optimal service level, or critical ratio (\(CR\)), is calculated as:

\[CR = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}\]

Plugging in the values:

\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

\[CR â‰?0.6364\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Demand Distribution
With the provided tuples (order quantity, observed demand): [(13, 10), (10, 6), (6, 6)], we need to understand the demand distribution to apply the critical ratio.

Each tuple represents a day's order vs. demand scenario. We can deduce the demand frequency:

- Demand of 6: 2 days
- Demand of 10: 1 day

Thus, the probability of demand being 6 is \(2/3\) and for 10 is \(1/3\).

### Step 5: Find the Optimal Order Quantity
To find the optimal order quantity that corresponds to the critical ratio, we look for the quantity at which the cumulative probability of demand (starting from the lowest) first exceeds or meets the critical ratio \(CR = 0.6364\).

Given the probabilities:
- Probability (Demand â‰?6) = \(2/3\)
- Probability (Demand â‰?10) = \(1\), adding the previous probabilities

The cumulative probability meets or exceeds the critical ratio first at demand â‰?6.

However, choosing a demand of 6 might ignore potential higher demand seen historically (once as 10). Given our CR and the fact that we've calculated probabilities directly from occurrences, it might lead to overturning this simplistic decision process, suggesting we should prepare for higher than the most common demand since our CR suggests a marginal willingness to overstock based on the potential profit opportunity.

With a critical ratio of about 0.6364, we're targeting a demand percentile just above 2/3. The only demand above 6 in our data is 10, but since our data is minimal and not diverse, we'll align with the higher observed demand to optimize potential revenue, considering the critical ratio suggests being prepared for approximately 63.64% of the demand distribution we have.

### Conclusion
Observing the above, while the simplistic interpretation of frequency directly leads to optimal demand estimation does not fully apply due to our specific critical ratio and the limited data points available, an analysis adhering to the principle of newsboy model suggests adjusting order closer to higher observed demand, especially in light of trying to capture more of the market up to the CR level.

Therefore, considering the CR and a strategic view:

3,5,"[(7, 1), (14, 2), (4, 1)]",2.461648126,7.153388311,2,1,2,"The newsboy model, also known as the newsvendor model or single-period inventory model, is used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the cost of inventory, considering both the cost of having excess inventory (overage cost) and the cost of having too little inventory (underage cost). Let's apply this model step by step:

1. **Understand the Given Data**:
   - Historical order and demand data are given as [(7, 1), (14, 2), (4, 1)]. Each tuple represents (order quantity, observed demand) for a day.
   - Selling price is $11 per unit.
   - Ordering (or overage) cost is $4 per unit. This is the cost of ordering one unit more than the demand.

2. **Determine the Underage Cost (Cu)**:
   - The underage cost is the loss from having one unit less than the demand. It is the profit lost, which is the selling price minus the cost per unit. Since the cost per unit is not directly given, we use the given overage cost to deduce it.
   - Typically, the cost per unit is more nuanced to calculate directly from overage cost without additional information. In traditional problem settings, we might infer costs based on other given parameters or profits. However, we'll focus on the given components for this solution. 
   - Since direct calculation of cost per unit from overage cost is not standard without more information (like salvage value or a direct cost per unit), we'll proceed by considering the selling price per item as a proxy for assessing the underage cost, acknowledging this simplification due to limited data. Therefore, in this context, the underage cost (Cu) is essentially the selling price or $11, as it represents the revenue lost per unit for not meeting demand.

3. **Calculate Probabilities of Demand**:
   - From the historical data, calculate the probability of different demands. Observed demands are 1 and 2 units.
   - Demand of 1: observed twice in three occurrences, so probability P(1) = 2/3.
   - Demand of 2: observed once in three occurrences, so probability P(2) = 1/3.

4. **Calculate the Optimal Service Level (Critical Ratio) (CR)**:
   - The critical ratio is calculated by Cu / (Cu + Co), where Cu is the underage cost and Co is the overage cost.
   - Cu = $11, Co = $4.
   - CR = $11 / ($11 + $4) = 11 / 15 = 0.7333.

5. **Determine the Optimal Order Quantity**:
   - We need to find the smallest order quantity (Q) where the cumulative probability of demand is greater than or equal to the critical ratio (CR).
   - With our calculated probabilities: P(1) = 2/3 (or ~0.6667), P(2) = 1/3 (when added to P(1) gives a cumulative probability of 1).
   - Since CR is 0.7333, we look for the demand level at which cumulative probability exceeds this. P(1) does not exceed CR, but the cumulative probability for demand=1 and demand=2 combined does.
   - Thus, the demand level that matches this condition is 2 since it's the point where the cumulative probability (P(1) + P(2) = 1) exceeds CR.

Therefore, based on the newsboy model's calculations, the **optimal order quantity for the next day** is:

3,6,"[(6, 6), (7, 4), (4, 4)]",5.506719116,6.980598865,8,4,],"The Newsboy Model, also known as the Single-Period Inventory Problem, is designed to help determine the optimal order quantity when dealing with perishable goods or items with a limited selling period. This involves balancing the cost of ordering too much against the cost of ordering too little.

Given are tuples representing the order quantity and observed demand for each day, the selling price per unit, and the overage cost per unit (ordering cost). The tuples provided are: [(6, 6), (7, 4), (4, 4)].

The critical ratio (CR) is needed to find the optimal order quantity, which is calculated as:
\[ CR = \frac{Selling Price - Overage Cost}{Selling Price} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} \]
\[ CR = \frac{7}{11} \]

This ratio will help us find the optimal service level, meaning the probability of selling all units ordered.

Next, we need to estimate the demand distribution from the data given. The observed demands are 6, 4, and 4. We should calculate the probability of each demand level occurring. Although our sample size is very small, we proceed with the information available:

- Demand of 4: 2 out of 3 times
- Demand of 6: 1 out of 3 times

Thus, the probabilities are:
- P(Demand=4) = 2/3
- P(Demand=6) = 1/3

Considering we need to find the demand level at which the cumulative probability is just above the CR of 7/11, we calculate the cumulative probabilities. In this simplified example, our calculation is straightforward because we only have two demand levels. The cumulative probability for a demand of 4 is 2/3, and adding the probability for a demand of 6 makes it 3/3 or 1.

Given that the CR is 7/11 (approximately 0.636), we look for where the cumulative probability exceeds this value:
- The cumulative probability exceeds 0.636 after a demand level of 4.

Thus, the optimal order quantity according to the Newsboy Model, given the very limited and simplified dataset, would be aligned with expecting the demand of 4 because ordering for 6 (next higher demand level) doesn't improve our position relative to the critical ratio identified.

However, it's essential to take this analysis with caution, as the model's accuracy is heavily dependent on the richness of the data it has. With only three data points, our estimation of demand distribution and subsequent decisions may not be very robust.

This model aims to find the balance between the cost of ordering too many units (overage cost) and the profit lost by not ordering enough to meet demand (underage cost). Here, the selling price per unit is $11, and the ordering (overage) cost per unit is $4. Let's break down the process:

1. **Understanding the Costs:**
   - Selling Price (\(P\)) = $11
   - Ordering (Overage) Cost (\(C_o\)) = $4
   - Since the shortage (underage) cost isn't directly provided, we can calculate it as the difference between the selling price and the overage cost. So, Underage Cost (\(C_u\)) = \(P - C_o = $11 - $4 = $7\).

   - The critical ratio (\(CR\)) is calculated as \(\frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}\). This will guide us in determining the optimal service level.
   - Plugging in the costs: \(CR = \frac{$7}{$7 + $4} = \frac{7}{11}\).

3. **Analyzing Demand:**
   - From the data [(14, 0), (8, 0), (11, 2)], we can see the demand levels reported. However, it's important to note that demand exceeds supply only once and that was 2 units with an order quantity of 11. This information alone may not provide a sufficient basis to accurately estimate a distribution of demand due to the small sample size. For the sake of this problem, let's move forward with the available information, keeping in mind this limitation.

Given the CR and the limited demand observations, we cannot directly apply a probability distribution without making significant assumptions. Hence, to guide our estimation for the next day's optimal order quantity, we look at the historical data critically:

- The only time demand was not zero was when 11 units were ordered. This implies, in a very simplistic analysis, that ordering at least 11 units might be a reasonable starting point.

Considering the simplistic nature of this analysis and the critical ratio, in a more detailed and statistical manner, the optimal order quantity often aligns with where the probability of selling an additional unit equals the critical ratio.

However, due to the lack of comprehensive demand data to properly calculate these probabilities, we have to rely on a basic understanding and the little information we have. Since the demand was met and exceeded only once at an order quantity of 11, and given that we are looking for a balance between overage and underage costs based on our critical ratio, it would be prudent to consider ordering a quantity close to 11 but adjusted for potential differences in demand patterns that aren't fully captured in the provided data. Yet, the exact optimal order quantity calculation using the newsboy model ideally requires a more detailed demand distribution or at least a larger dataset to accurately predict demand probabilities.

Given the simplified approach and acknowledging the method's limitations with the data at hand, we could hypothesize adjusting slightly upwards from 11 considering the single instance of unsatisfied demand, but without substantial data to further refine this guess, making a significant adjustment would be speculative.

This model aims to find the optimal order quantity that minimizes costs or maximizes profit when demand is uncertain. Here's how we'll approach it:

1. **Gather Required Information**:
    - Demand Data: We have this as a series of tuples showing past order quantities and actual demand.
    - Selling Price (P): \$11/unit
    - Ordering Cost or Overage Cost (C): \$4/unit
    - Not directly provided, but implied shortage cost (S) can be inferred as the difference between the selling price and the ordering cost, which is \$11 - \$4 = \$7/unit.

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**:
    The critical ratio is calculated as the cost of underordering divided by the total cost (cost of underordering plus cost of overordering), which in this context is the service level. The formula looks like this:
    \[ CR = \frac{S}{S + C} \]
    Substituting the given values:
    \[ CR = \frac{\$7}{\$7 + \$4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

3. **Analyze Demand Data**:
    To use the critical ratio effectively, we need to understand the distribution of demand. While we can't perfectly determine a distribution from three data points, we can glean some insight:
    - Demand instances: 2, 2, 2 (From tuples: (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2))

    It's apparent that with the very limited data provided, every observed demand is 2. Although this doesn't give us much to work on in terms of variability, it's all we have without making unsupported assumptions.

4. **Determine Optimal Order Quantity Based on Critical Ratio**:
    Since there is no variability in the given demand data, using the critical ratio directly to determine the variability-based demand level is challenging. Typically, you'd look for the point in your demand distribution where the probability of demand being less than or equal to a certain quantity matches the critical ratio. However, in this case, with a flat demand history, we might infer that ordering exactly according to historical demand is a safe bet.

5. **Conclusion**:
    Given the uniform demand history and the lack of variability in the data set, an optimal order strategy would be one that closely aligns with observed demand. Therefore, considering the demand has consistently been 2 units, a simplistic approach under the newsboy model with very limited data would also suggest:

3,9,"[(11, 5), (11, 3), (13, 3)]",4.622660653,10.25056281,4,3,.,"To deduce the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, let's break down the steps according to the model's requirements and the provided data. The newsboy model aims to find the optimal balance between overage and underage costs to minimize the total expected cost or equivalently, to maximize the expected profit.

Given:

1. **Historical order and demand data**: [(11, 5), (11, 3), (13, 3)]
2. **Selling price per unit** (\(P\)): \$11
3. **Ordering cost per unit** (\(C\)): \$4 (This is basically the overage cost, which occurs when you order more than you sell.)

The underage cost (\(Cu\)) is the lost profit for each unit that could have been sold but wasn't ordered. It's calculated as the difference between the selling price and the ordering cost: \[ Cu = P - C = \$11 - \$4 = \$7 \]

The critical ratio (\(CR\)) is then calculated as the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs: \[ CR = Cu / (Cu + C) = \$7 / (\$7 + \$4) = \$7 / \$11 = 7/11 \]

The critical ratio gives us the optimal service level, implying that the optimal order quantity should lead to having a probability of \(7/11\) of selling all ordered units.

From the provided data, we calculate the probability distribution of demand. Notice that the demands observed are 5, 3, and 3. Given this small sample, we see the probability of demand being 3 is \(2/3\) and being 5 is \(1/3\).

However, to apply the critical ratio directly to set the order quantity, we'd ideally have cumulative probabilities for different demand levels up to the point where the cumulative probability is just above \(7/11\). Given our limited data, it's a challenge to accurately calculate this, but we can infer an approach based on the provided information.

Normally, you would use a more extensive dataset to estimate a probability distribution for the demand, then calculate the cumulative probability distribution to find the smallest demand level where the cumulative probability is greater than the critical ratio \(7/11\). Given we have simplified and limited data, we're constrained in doing so accurately.

Given our limited dataset and the approximation that:

- The probability of demand being 3 units is high (\(2/3\)), and for 5 units is low (\(1/3\)); the exact desired demand level corresponding to a cumulative probability of \(7/11\) cannot be calculated accurately without more information or a more varied range of past demands.

Considering the critical ratio and the aim to maximize the expected profit without more nuanced data, it seems reasonable to ensure that the order quantity minimally covers the most frequent demand observed (which is 3, based on the frequencies in the provided data).

Therefore, given the constraints and understanding the principle of maximizing the probability of selling the ordered quantity without being able to accurately calculate the cumulative probability distribution, a conservative order quantity in line with the observed frequency (most common demand) might be considered optimal. However, this approach doesn't fully adhere to the traditional calculation methods due to data limitations.

Given these considerations and the intent to demonstrate the thought process rather than provide a numeric optimum without sufficient data, I suggest the following:

This represents a conservative stance based on the given data, aiming to cover observed demand without exceeding it significantly, acknowledging the limitations of the dataset provided for this exercise."
3,10,"[(16, 7), (15, 7), (26, 2)]",6.524626949,16.86352913,6,7,*,"To deduce the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the provided historical order and demand data, we'll follow a step-by-step approach. The newsboy problem, also known as the single-period inventory problem, aims to find the order quantity that maximizes the expected profit, considering the balance between the cost of ordering too many (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too few (underage cost).

### Given Data:

1. Historical Order and Demand Data: [(16, 7), (15, 7), (26, 2)]
2. Selling Price per Unit: $11
3. Ordering Cost (Overage Cost) per Unit: $4

### Step 1: Calculate the Underage Cost
The underage cost (Cu) is the lost profit for each unit that is under-ordered. It's calculated as the selling price minus the cost price. However, since the cost price is not provided directly, we'll use the overage cost for now and focus on calculating the optimal order quantity.

- Selling Price (P) = $11
- Overage Cost (Co) = $4

### Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio
The critical ratio (CR) is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs. However, without the purchase cost, making a precise calculation of underage costs is tricky. A common approach in such cases is to focus on optimizing based on available data points and intuitive understanding of costs. Given that we're dealing essentially with selling price and overage costs, let's progress by considering the demand and supply points to formulate an optimal ordering strategy that minimizes the overage situation and gets closer to real demand.

### Step 3: Analyze Historical Demand
From the data [(16, 7), (15, 7), (26, 2)], we see that the demand has been significantly lower than the order quantity in each case. To minimize costs and maximize potential profit, analyzing the demand can give us insight into customer behavior and a basis for the new order quantity.

Observing the demand, we can calculate:
- Average Demand = (7 + 7 + 2) / 3 = 5.33

Given the goal is to optimally meet demand without excessive overage, the average demand can serve as an initial point of reference for the next order quantity decision. However, the newsboy model seeks to balance overage and underage costs, and without clear underage costs, optimizing strictly on average demand could be simplistic.

### Step 4: Optimal Order Quantity
Given the complexities and the lack of precise cost information necessary for applying elements of the newsboy model accurately (specifically, the cost of goods sold which would help define underage costs), we'll lean on observed demand and attempt to control overage, acknowledging that in true newsboy model applications, we'd ideally utilize a probability distribution of demand to calculate the critical ratio and then use that to find the exact optimal order quantity.

The data shows a consistent overestimation of demand. Given our goal to optimize order quantities to balance the costs, and based on observed demand trends, a cautious approach would reduce the order quantity closer to the average observed demand but consider the potential for higher demand not yet reflected.

### Final Calculation and Decision
Considering the observed average demand (approximately 5.33), and aiming to cautiously increase to capture potential unmet demand:

- Proposed Order Quantity for Next Day = Round up from Average Demand = 6 (rounded from 5.33, deciding to round up reflects a conservative approach to potential unmet demand, balancing overage risks given the information available).

Given the data and costs, we can calculate the optimal order quantity step by step.

1. **Determine Demand Distribution**: From the given tuples [(7, 7), (9, 9), (9, 8)], we extract the demand data: 7, 9, and 8.

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**: The critical ratio is calculated using the formula:
\[ CR = \frac{Selling\ Price - Ordering\ Cost}{Selling\ Price} \]
Given selling price = $11 and ordering cost (overage cost) = $4,
\[ CR = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

3. **Determine the Optimal Service Level**: The optimal service level is where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand is equal to or just above the critical ratio. From our demand data, we need to determine what demand level has a CDF equal or just above 0.6364.

4. **Estimate Demand Probability Distribution**: We have three demand observations: 7, 8, and 9. From our small sample:
   - P(Demand=7) = 1/3
   - P(Demand=8) = 1/3
   - P(Demand=9) = 1/3

5. **Calculate Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
   - CDF(7) = P(Demand <= 7) = P(Demand=7) = 1/3
   - CDF(8) = P(Demand <= 8) = P(Demand=7) + P(Demand=8) = 2/3
   - CDF(9) = P(Demand <= 9) = 1 (P(Demand=7)+P(Demand=8)+P(Demand=9))

6. **Identify Optimal Order Quantity**: To match or exceed the CR of approximately 0.6364:
   - At CDF(7) = 1/3, the CR is not met.
   - At CDF(8) = 2/3, the CR is exceeded as 2/3 is greater than 0.6364.

Thus, the optimal order quantity (where the demand's CDF just meets or exceeds the CR of 0.6364) is at a demand level of 8.

The newsboy model is used to determine the optimal inventory level that minimizes the risk of stocking too much or too little, balancing the costs of having excess inventory against the costs of having an unmet demand.

1. **Understand the Data**: We have historical order and demand data as tuples, where the first number is the order quantity and the second is the observed demand for each day:
   - [(8, 8), (5, 5), (5, 5)]

2. **Identify the Parameters**:
   - Selling Price ($P$) = 11
   - Ordering Cost or Overage Cost ($C$) = 4
   - Shortage Cost ($S$) isn't provided directly but can be inferred as the missed profit from not selling an item, which is $P - C = 11 - 4 = 7$.

3. **Calculate the Critical Ratio**:
   The critical ratio ($CR$) is the ratio of the cost of underestimating demand (shortage cost, $S$) to the total cost of misestimating demand (the sum of the shortage cost, $S$, and the ordering or overage cost, $C$): 
   \[
   CR = \frac{S}{S + C}
   \]
   Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364
   \]

4. **Determine the Optimal Service Level**:
   The optimal service level is the probability of not running out of stock, and it corresponds to our critical ratio, which is approximately 0.6364. 

5. **Analyze Demand Data to Find the Optimal Order Quantity**:
   Given the simplicity of our demand data, where demand perfectly matched supply every day (8, 5, and 5), there's no variability to inform a typical probabilistic approach. Since all observed demands were met exactly, suggesting no observed days of excess or shortage, the critical ratio analysis might initially seem irrelevant.

   However, the decision for optimal inventory under the newsboy model typically requires understanding or estimating the distribution of demand. In our simplistic scenario, without the presence of variability or given probabilities for different demand levels, one might argue for continuing to match historical demand.

   But to apply the concept more theoretically, if we had a distribution or more varied data, we'd look for the demand level corresponding to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) equal to our critical ratio (CR), which is about 0.6364. Since our data shows no variability, and assuming demand is constant (not usually the case in real-life applications of the newsboy model), we might cautiously consider an order quantity that reflects the historical demand.

6. **Decision Based on Limited Data**:
   The optimal approach with given data, if we were to introduce a notion of applying the critical ratio without a clear demand distribution, would be to observe if any pattern or higher demand expectation exists beyond our simple dataset. In the real world, more complex analysis involving historical variability and future demand forecasting would be necessary.

   Since the demand has been constant at 5 units (excluding the first day), with no variability to apply the CR directly, and without further data to suggest a change in demand pattern, the optimal order quantity under these constraints is somewhat speculative but rooted in the available data trend.

7. **Conclusion and Optimal Order Quantity**:
   Given the very limited scenario and aiming to minimize the risk of stockouts or overage without further demand insights, one might lean towards ordering based on the most recent and frequent demand pattern, which has been consistently 5 units. Thus, the recommended optimal order quantity for the next day, simplistically applying the newsboy model to our constrained dataset, would be:

3,13,"[(10, 8), (12, 7), (6, 6)]",8.829243639,7.480209245,9,7,.,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model, we follow these steps:

### 1. Understand the Newsboy Model Context
The newsboy model helps in decision-making about how much inventory to order in the face of uncertain demand. The goal is to find the order quantity that maximizes profit or minimizes costs, balancing the costs of ordering too much (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too little (underage cost, which is the lost profit from not meeting demand).

### 2. Define the Terms
- **Selling Price (P)**: $11
- **Ordering Cost (C)**: $4
- **Overage Cost (Co)**: The cost when an item is left over, which here equals the ordering cost, $4.
- **Underage Cost (Cu)**: The lost profit for not meeting demand, which is P - C = $11 - $4 = $7.

### 3. Calculate the Critical Ratio (Cr)
The critical ratio helps decide the optimal service level. It is given by:
\[ Cr = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

This means to maximize profit, we should aim to have a service level or probability of not stocking out of approximately 63.64%.

### 4. Analyze Historical Data
Given data: \[(10, 8), (12, 7), (6, 6)\]

We first calculate the probabilities of demands:
- Calculate observed demands: \[8, 7, 6\]
- Frequencies of demands can be inferred as having at least one occurrence given the small sample.
- Assuming these are the only observed demand levels, the simplified probabilities are evenly distributed among observed demands for this example.

### 5. Determine the Optimal Order Quantity
The optimal order quantity corresponds to the demand level at which the cumulative probability is just above or equal to the critical ratio (Cr).

Given our simplistic interpretation of demand probabilities from the small sample, the demands are 6, 7, and 8. A detailed probability distribution and cumulative probability calculation are ideal, but due to the simplicity of this example and the absence of explicit frequency data for each demand level, we interpret the optimal order quantity based on the critical ratio and the given data directly.

Since the critical ratio is about 63.64%, we look for a demand just above this percentage. Given our limited dataset and assuming equal probability distribution for simplicity, any sophisticated calculation exceeds the data's capability to accurately represent diverse scenarios.

Thus, we infer the optimal order quantity within the confines of the given data and the critical ratio. Ideally, with a critical ratio of about 63.64%, and if we were to distribute probabilities equally across observed demand levels (6, 7, 8), the decision would lean towards ordering a quantity that meets or slightly exceeds the demand observed at the lower to middle range of our dataset, considering our aim to not exceed the critical ratio significantly while also minimizing overage and underage costs.

Given this context, observing demand trends, and if assuming equal probability for each demand level (simplification):

- Ordering at least 6 aligns with the lowest observed demand. Given our critical ratio, there is an indication towards ordering slightly more.
- Ordering above 8 would unnecessarily increase the risk of overage, given the observed demands.

Therefore, a slightly conservative but more informed guess from observed data and aiming close to the critical ratio, without specific probabilities for each demand level, suggests:

This order quantity is an educated guess rooted in the simplistic interpretation of the newsboy model given the limited dataset and instructions. It aims to balance the risks and costs associated with overage and underage in light of the critical ratio calculated."
3,14,"[(16, 6), (14, 2), (12, 2)]",3.920746453,13.93533193,4,2,6,"To determine the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model, let's break down this problem step by step, focusing on the required concepts and calculations involving the given data. The newsboy model, also known as the single-period model, helps in deciding the optimal inventory level, balancing costs between ordering too much (overage cost) and not ordering enough to meet demand (underage cost). Here's how we proceed:

1. **Determine Underage and Overage Costs:**  
- **Underage Cost (Cu):** This is the lost profit for each unit that is under-ordered, calculated as the selling price minus the cost of ordering. If we don't have the cost of the item, we consider only the selling price, which in this case is $11.
- **Overage Cost (Co):** This is given as the ordering cost or the cost of overordering, which is $4 per unit.

2. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR):**  
The CR helps to determine the optimal service level and is calculated by Cu / (Cu + Co). Here, 
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{11}{11 + 4} = \frac{11}{15}\]

3. **Assess Historical Demand:**  
Given the data on order quantity and observed demand: \[(16, 6), (14, 2), (12, 2)\], we need to deduce the probability distribution of demand. We can see three observations of demand (6, 2, 2).

4. **Calculate Demand Probabilities:**  
For demand of 6, there's 1 occurrence out of 3; thus, P(D=6) = 1/3.  
For demand of 2, there are 2 occurrences out of 3; thus, P(D=2) = 2/3.

5. **Deduce Demand Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**  
We order the demands in ascending order and calculate their cumulative probabilities.  
For D=2: Cumulative P = 2/3.  
For D=6: Cumulative P = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1 (100%).

6. **Find the Demand Level at or Just Above CR:**  
The critical ratio found was CR = 11/15 â‰?0.7333. We look for where the cumulative probability of demand is just equal to or exceeds this CR to find our optimal order quantity.

- For D=2, Cumulative P = 2/3 â‰?0.6667, which is below the CR.
- For D=6, Cumulative P = 1, which is above the CR.

We then choose the demand level that has a cumulative probability equal to or just above the CR, which is 6 in this case.

7. **Determine Optimal Order Quantity:**  
From the analysis, the optimal order quantity is determined based on the demand level corresponding to or just above our critical ratio, which is a demand of 6 units. Thus, the optimal order quantity considering excess costs and the potential of under-selling is to order to meet a demand of 6 units.

**Conclusion:**  
Hence, the optimal order quantity for the next day, utilizing the newsboy model and the given historical order and demand data, is:

Given:
- Selling price per unit = $11
- Ordering (overage) cost per unit = $4
- No explicit salvage value for unsold items provided, so we infer it to be $11 (selling price) - $4 (ordering cost) = $7.

The critical ratio (CR) is calculated as follows:
\[
CR = \frac{Selling Price - Cost}{Selling Price - Salvage Value} = \frac{11 - 4}{11 - 7} = \frac{7}{4}
\]
\[
CR = 1.75
\]

The critical ratio tells us the proportion of times we want our demand to be less than or equal to our stock level to maximize profit. Since we cannot directly apply this ratio to find the exact order quantity without the demand probability distribution, we'll analyze the provided historical order and demand data to estimate the optimal order quantity:

Historical data:
1. Day 1: Ordered 21, Demand 4
2. Day 2: Ordered 15, Demand 0
3. Day 3: Ordered 17, Demand 3

Step 1: Calculate Excess and Shortfall from Historical Data
In all scenarios provided, there is only excess; there's no instance where demand exceeded supply, making it hard to directly estimate the demand probability distribution. However, we can infer that ordering quantities were higher than needed in all instances.

Step 2: Infer Demand Distribution
Since we don't have explicit probabilities linked to each demand scenario and the sample is small, we cannot precisely calculate the optimal order quantity directly using the CR. But, we can adjust our approach based on observed results:
- The highest demand was 4 (on Day 1), and the orders have generally been quite above the demand.

Step 3: Estimation for Optimal Order Quantity
Given the overestimation in all cases and aiming to align closer to the higher demand observed (4 units), while considering the critical ratio, we need to adjust orders closer to a point where the chance of selling all ordered items is aligned with our CR. However, without precise probabilities of demand, the exact CR application becomes challenging.

From the data, we know:
- Demand has never exceeded 4.
- Orders have always been significantly above demand.

An approach to estimating the optimal order quantity could involve moderating the order amount to better align with the highest demand observed, possibly increasing it slightly to account for variation but keeping it below the lowest order quantity to date (15).

Step 4: Conclusion and Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day
Since a detailed probability distribution is not available, we need to cautiously infer from given data. One might consider ordering slightly above the highest recorded demand to cover potential underestimation yet caution against excessive overage costs. Given the conservative approach highlighted by the newsboy model and considering the highest demand has been 4, an optimal order amount could be proposed slightly higher than this to hedge against variability but significantly lower than all previous order amounts.

A reasoned guess for the next day, aiming to balance the risk of over-ordering with the desire not to miss out on potential sales (and considering the highest demand was 4), might be to order a few units more than the highest demand observed but still remain conservative:

Optimal order quantity for next day = 6"
3,16,"[(6, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4)]",3.315650546,7.569527798,3,2,*,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy model, we will follow the methodological steps of this inventory control problem. 

The newsboy model, or newsvendor model, is used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the cost associated with ordering too many or too few items. It's crucial when dealing with perishable goods or items with a limited selling period. The model revolves around balancing the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too few (underage cost).

Given:
- Historical order and demand data: [(6, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4)]
- Selling price: $11
- Overage cost (ordering cost if too many are ordered): $4

First, we need to understand the components:
- The overage cost (C_o) is the cost of ordering one unit too many, which is $4.
- The underage cost (C_u) is the cost of ordering one unit too few. This is calculated as the selling price minus the cost of one unit, which effectively would be the lost profit. Given no explicit cost per unit is provided, we consider the lost profit (selling price - cost per unit) as the underage cost. Here, we only have the selling price, so for calculation simplicity, the underage cost is the selling price, which is $11.

**Step 1**: Calculate the critical ratio (CR).
The critical ratio is calculated using the formula CR = C_u / (C_u + C_o), where C_u is the underage cost and C_o is the overage cost.

\[CR = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o} = \frac{11}{11 + 4} = \frac{11}{15}\]

\[CR = 0.7333\]

**Step 2**: Calculate the probability of selling up to a certain quantity.
This involves using the historical demand to figure out the probabilities associated with selling up to certain quantities. However, with the given data, creating a comprehensive distribution is challenging due to the small sample size. But for the sake of simplicity, let's approximate the demand distribution from the provided data points and find a suitable approach to match or approximate to the critical ratio.

**Assumption for Simplification**: Given the small dataset, we might proceed by averaging or finding a suitable probability approximation for demands near to matching the CR. Normally, a more extensive dataset would allow us to precisely calculate the probability distribution of demand.

Given data points for demand cannot directly lead us to a continuous distribution or a precise match to the CR without making several assumptions due to the limited data. To construct a more general approach with the given information, we would normally calculate or use historical probabilities of demands occurring at or below specific quantities and match these to the CR.

**For simplicity here and without complicating our approach with a makeshift distribution:**
From the data, demand observations are 1, 2, and 4. If we were to look for a pattern or use these data points directly to approximate or match the CR, it's not directly feasible with such limited data. 

**Note**: In real applications, the strategy might involve mapping known probabilities of demand to find the closest to the CR. Without explicit probabilities or a larger dataset, making a detailed analysis is challenging.

However, understanding the model's goal, we should order up to the point where the probability of selling that quantity is just less than or equal to the CR.

Given the limitations, a heuristic approach might consider ordering slightly above the average demand noticed. The demands noted are 1, 2, and 4; assuming uniform probability for demonstration purposes due to the data's simplicity:

Average demand = (1 + 2 + 4) / 3 = 7 / 3 â‰?2.33.

Given no clear way to precisely apply the CR without more detailed demand probabilities, and based on the simplistic analysis:

One might consider ordering at a quantity marginally above the average observed demand to balance the inventory cost and potential sales. However, this does not strictly follow from the critical ratio due to the limitations specified.

**Given the constraints and aiming to make a practical interpretation without overstepping the available data for CR application**:

The optimal order quantity estimation, by pure heuristic and not by strict application of the newsboy model principles due to data limitations, could be adjusted upwards from the average to cater to potential demand without significantly risking overage costs. 

Considering the dataset's simplicity and limitations:

\[Optimal Order Quantity \approx \text{Round up from average demand}\]

Based on a heuristic approach from the observed average, considering we cannot accurately apply the CR with the data directly, a cautious approach might be ordering a quantity that's slightly higher but considers potential overage risks.

Therefore, a sensible heuristic might suggest:

3,17,"[(12, 1), (11, 3), (9, 1)]",1.061738981,8.679499535,2,1,1,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy model with the given data, let's follow the methodology step by step:

1. **Understanding Variables**:
    - **CU**: The cost of underordering per unit (shortage cost) is the difference between the selling price and the purchase cost. However, the purchase cost isn't provided directly. We will use the selling price minus the overage cost as an approximation.
    - **CO**: The cost of overordering per unit (overage cost) is given directly as 4.
    - **Selling Price (P)**: Each unit sells for 11.
  
2. **Calculate CU**:
    CU = P - CO = 11 - 4 = 7

Given that CU is 7 and CO is 4, we can now calculate the critical ratio (CR), which is essential for determining the optimal order quantity. The CR is calculated using the formula:

\[ CR = \frac{CU}{CU + CO} \]

3. **Calculate CR**:
\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

Now, using the CR, we need to find a point on the cumulative probability distribution of demand that matches or closely matches this ratio. The distribution of demand will be deduced from the historical data provided: [(12, 1), (11, 3), (9, 1)]. These tuples represent (Order Quantity, Observed Demand), but for the newsboy model, we're particularly interested in the demand side.

4. **Construct Demand Distribution**:
From the observed data, the demands were 1, 3, and 1 on different days. To construct a cumulative probability distribution, let's sort them first: [1, 1, 3].

5. **Cumulative Probability Distribution**:
- **Total Observations**: 3 (n=3)
- Sorted Demands: 1, 1, 3
- Cumulative probability for each demand level:
    - P(Demand â‰?1) = 2/3 (Since '1' appears twice)
    - P(Demand â‰?3) = 3/3 = 1

6. **Finding Optimal Order Quantity**:
We need to order a quantity such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to this quantity is as close as possible to CR (0.636). Based on our cumulative probabilities:
    - P(Demand â‰?1) = 0.667 is just above the CR of 0.636.

Given that the closest cumulative probability to our CR is for a demand of 1, and considering the distribution of our demand data, we can infer that ordering just above this demand level might align with our critical ratio. However, this is a very simplistic approach due to the limited data range. Ideally, with more data points, we would look for the exact or closest cumulative probability matching or just exceeding the CR, but with such limited data, we should lean towards the cautious side of meeting the demand without overstocking too much.

7. **Conclusion**:
While the method suggests considering a demand level of 1 based on our strict calculations and the critical ratio, practical intuition might suggest ordering slightly more to accommodate potential increases in demand not fully captured by this limited dataset. With only the options of 1 or 3 to work with and given the costs involved, the calculated approach points towards ordering for a demand of 1, but with acknowledgment of the limitations present in this dataset.

3,18,"[(13, 9), (27, 8), (22, 8)]",9.666533831,18.21677344,9,8,3,"To solve this problem using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we need to determine the optimal order quantity that maximizes the expected profit or minimizes the expected loss by balancing the overage cost (cost of ordering too much) against the underage cost (cost of ordering too little). Here's how we approach it step by step:

1. **Understand the Given Data**: We have tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for several days, specifically [(13, 9), (27, 8), (22, 8)]. We're also given that the selling price is $11 per unit, and the ordering (overage) cost is $4 per unit. 

2. **Understanding Costs**: 
   - The selling price per unit is $11.
   - The overage cost per unit is $4. If we order more units than the demand, each unsold unit costs us $4.
   - The underage cost per unit is the cost of lost sales, which is the selling price minus the cost price. However, we are not given the cost price directly, so we can consider the lost profit on each missed sale as the underage cost. In this case, it is not explicitly stated, so the underage cost would traditionally be seen as the selling price.

3. **Calculating the Critical Ratio (CR)**: The CR is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs. Since we're not given the cost price directly, we'll consider the selling price as a proxy for the potential loss from underordering. Therefore, CR = Underage Cost / (Underage Cost + Overage Cost) = $11 / ($11 + $4). This simplifies to CR = $11 / $15.

4. **CR Calculation**: Plugging in the numbers, CR = 11 / 15 = 0.7333.

5. **Estimating Demand Distribution**: To apply the CR and determine the optimal order quantity, we typically need to know or estimate the cumulative probability distribution of demand. Given the data points for demand, we have observed demands of 9, 8, and 8. This is a very limited dataset to accurately estimate a distribution but let's proceed with an understanding that in a real-world application, we'd need a larger dataset to make a more accurate prediction.

6. **Determining Optimal Order Quantity**:
   - With such limited data and without a clear distribution of demand, a precise calculation following the traditional newsboy model framework is challenging. The model usually requires a known distribution of demand or a larger dataset from which we can infer probabilities for different demand levels.
   - However, in a simplified approach given our limited data, we'd look for a demand level that aligns with our CR if we had a proper probability distribution. Since the model fundamentally requires understanding the probability distribution of demand to determine at what demand level the cumulative probability equals the critical ratio, without this distribution, we can't accurately apply the CR directly.

7. **Practical Approach**: Given the data points, an exact application of the newsboy formula is not straightforward. However, recognising this limitation, a simple average of the past demands (9, 8, 8) could serve as a basic proxy to determine our next order quantity, keeping in mind that this approach lacks the sophistication and accuracy of applying the newsboy model correctly with a known demand distribution.

8. **Calculate Average Demand**: The average demand is (9 + 8 + 8) / 3 = 25 / 3 = 8.33.

Given the limitations of our data and the constraints in applying the model strictly by its mathematical formulation, our best estimate with the provided simplistic approach would suggest ordering according to the average past demand, acknowledging the critical ratio and our understanding of costs would typically guide this decision with a more accurately estimated demand distribution.

Thus, the optimal order quantity for the next day, based on a simplified calculation and not strictly following the newsboy model due to the limitations mentioned, would be approximately:

3,19,"[(15, 1), (21, 4), (15, 0)]",3.566742677,17.70985167,2,1,1,"To solve this problem using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we must first understand the model. The newsboy model is a way to determine the optimal inventory level (in this case, the optimal order quantity) that minimizes the risk of having too much stock (overage) or too little stock (underage) to meet demand. The key to solving the newsboy model is to balance the costs of overage and underage to find the order quantity where the marginal cost of ordering one more unit equals the marginal benefit of having one more unit in inventory.

Given data:
Selling price (\(P\)) = 11
Ordering cost or overage cost (\(C\)) = 4
Underage cost (\(Cu\)) can be calculated as \(P - C\), which is \(11 - 4 = 7\).
The overage cost (\(Co\)) is the given ordering cost, which is 4.

We are given tuples of (order quantity, observed demand) for each day: [(15, 1), (15, 0), (21, 4)].

The probability of demand being equal to or less than any given quantity can be represented as \(P(D \leq Q)\), where \(D\) is the demand and \(Q\) is the quantity. The newsboy model aims to set this probability to \(Cu / (Cu + Co)\).

Step 1: Calculate the Critical Ratio (\(CR\)).

The critical ratio is calculated as:
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\]

Step 2: Calculating demand probabilities requires understanding the distribution of demand from the provided data. However, with only three data points, assuming a distribution might be inaccurate. Instead, we'll try to get a basic understanding of the frequency of demand to approximate probabilities.

Demand levels observed: 0, 1, and 4.
Occurrences:
- Demand of 0: 1 time
- Demand of 1: 1 time
- Demand of 4: 1 time

We have a small sample, but for simplicity, let's use these observations to estimate probabilities.
- Probability of \(D=0\): 1/3
- Probability of \(D=1\): 1/3
- Probability of \(D \leq 1\): 2/3
- Probability of \(D=4\): 1/3
- Probability of \(D \leq 4\): 3/3 (or 1, since all observed demands are less than or equal to 4)

Step 3: Matching the critical ratio with demand probabilities to suggest the optimal order quantity.

We look for a demand level \(D\) where the probability \(P(D \leq Q)\) is just greater than or equal to the critical ratio \(CR\). With the rough, assumed probabilities:
- \(CR = 0.6364\)
- Probability of \(D \leq 1\) = 0.6667, which is just over the CR.

Given the coarse grain of our data and its distribution, choosing a demand level that corresponds to \(D \leq 1\) seems most in line with the critical ratio, suggesting an order quantity that meets or slightly exceeds a demand of 1 would be optimal. However, with the limitations of this approach and the data provided, a precise optimal quantity is hard to pinpoint accurately.

Given the constraints and goals:
- The optimal order quantity should meet expected demand just over the critical ratio.
- With very limited data and simple probability estimations, the optimal order quantity based on our calculations and the critical ratio would be around the demands we have seen, slightly exceeding 1 but not too high to significantly risk overage.

Considering practicality and the fact our calculations suggest leaning toward a demand of 1 based on probabilities, yet also recognizing the simplistic analysis:

1"
3,20,"[(13, 6), (11, 11), (9, 9)]",8.243599522,12.04924623,12,9,.,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model (also known as the Newsvendor model), let's follow the steps outlined, using the historical order and demand data provided. The data consists of tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day, given as [(13, 6), (11, 11), (9, 9)]. We have a selling price of 11 and an ordering cost (overage cost) of 4.

### Step 1: Calculate the critical ratio (CR)

First, we need to calculate the critical ratio, which is the ratio of the cost of underordering (Cu) to the total of the costs of underordering (Cu) and overordering (Co). Since we are given the selling price ($11) and the ordering cost ($4), we can calculate the costs of underordering (Cu) and overordering (Co) as follows:

- \(Cu = Selling~Price - Ordering~Cost = 11 - 4 = 7\)
- \(Co = Ordering~Cost = 4\)

Therefore, the critical ratio (CR) is:

\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

### Step 2: Calculate the demand probabilities

Based on the provided data, let's determine the probability of demand:

- The observations of demand are 6, 11, and 9.
- To simplify, we assume these are the only demand scenarios and that each one is equally likely (since no further information on probabilities is provided).

Total scenarios = 3. Therefore, the probability of each demand scenario happening is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

### Step 3: Determine the demand probabilities less than or equal to the critical ratio

Since we've simplified the demand probabilities to be equal for each observed demand and we directly observe demand without discrete demand probabilities over a range, we need to adjust our approach for the newsboy model to fit our simplified case. Generally, we would look for the demand probability that is closest to but not less than the critical ratio (CR). However, in this simplified scenario, weâ€™ll have to interpret or adjust our approach.

Given the critical ratio is \(\frac{7}{11}\) or approximately \(0.636\), and we do not have a traditional demand distribution with probabilities, we consider the expectations or how to align the decision closest to the CR.

### Step 4: Choose the optimal order quantity according to CR

Typically, we would look for a demand quantity where the cumulative probability is closest to but not less than the CR. In this case, we need to infer the best approach from the given tuples since we don't have a smooth distribution of demand probabilities.

Since our model and data are quite simplified, and without a clear cumulative probability distribution based on discrete demands, one straightforward interpretation in actual practice would be to estimate demand as the average or a demand level that matches our risk level indicated by CR.

Given the demands observed were 6, 11, and 9, the average demand is \(\frac{6 + 11 + 9}{3} = \frac{26}{3}\) â‰?8.67. This average demand would typically serve as our guide in the absence of a more traditional application of the newsboy model methodology.

### Final Step: Determine the optimal order quantity for the next day

Considering the model's limitations with the data provided and focusing on the principle of matching supply with expected demand while considering the critical ratio as a guide for our risk of overage versus shortage, the nearest whole number to the average demand (leading to fewer overage costs while attempting to maximize profit) would be advisable.

Thus, considering rounding to the nearest whole number and the data provided, an optimal order quantity might be:

This is a simplified calculation based on the provided data, and it assumes equal likelihood for observed demands. Normally, a more detailed distribution of potential demand scenarios and their respective probabilities would inform a more precise application of the newsboy model."
4,1,"[(16, 6), (10, 10), (12, 7), (11, 4)]",6.114367181,12.8571703,8,7,7,"To deduce the optimal order quantity using the **newsboy model** (also known as the newsvendor model), we have to understand the modelâ€™s basic premise first. It deals with optimally balancing the costs associated with underordering and overordering. In this particular problem, the overage cost (the cost when we order more than we sell) is given as 4, which is the cost of ordering an item that is not sold. The underordering cost (the cost when demand exceeds supply) is the lost profit for each unsold item, which in this case would be the selling price minus the ordering cost, hence \(11 - 4 = 7\).

**Step 1: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**
The critical ratio is given by:

\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\]

where \(Cu\) is the underordering cost and \(Co\) is the overage cost.

Plugging the values in:

\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Probability Distribution of Demand**
To calculate the optimal order quantity, we need the probability distribution of demand from historical data. From the provided data, first, we calculate the occurrences of different demand levels:

- The demands from the data points are 6, 10, 7, and 4.
- Let's calculate the frequency of each demand level occurring based on the historical data. 

Since the optimal ordering quantity largely depends on the cumulative probability matching or exceeding the critical ratio, let's organize demand in ascending order with their probabilities:

1. Demand of 4 occurs once.
2. Demand of 6 occurs once.
3. Demand of 7 occurs once.
4. Demand of 10 occurs once.

Given the small dataset, each demand level has occurred exactly once out of 4 observations, so the probability for each demand level is \(1/4 = 0.25\).

**Step 3: Determine Cumulative Probability Distribution of Demand**
We need the cumulative probability associated with each demand level:

1. \(P(X\leq4)\) = 0.25
2. \(P(X\leq6)\) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50
3. \(P(X\leq7)\) = 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75
4. \(P(X\leq10)\) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1.00

**Step 4: Find the Optimal Order Quantity**
The optimal order quantity is where the cumulative probability first exceeds or equals the critical ratio, which is approximately 0.6364. Looking at the calculated cumulative probabilities:

1. For a demand of 4, the cumulative probability is 0.25 (too low).
2. For a demand of 6, the cumulative probability is 0.50 (still below CR).
3. For a demand of 7, the cumulative probability becomes 0.75, which is just above the critical ratio.

Therefore, according to the newsboy model, and based on our calculated cumulative probabilities, the optimal order quantity for the next day should be aligned with when the cumulative probability exceeds the CR, which corresponds to a demand of 7.

**Optimal Order Quantity**: 7"
4,2,"[(12, 12), (16, 16), (13, 10), (18, 13)]",9.874884668,14.86308699,16,13,3,"The Newsvendor (or Newsboy) model is a mathematical model used in inventory management to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the cost or maximizes the profit when there is uncertainty in demand. The model balances the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too little (underage cost). The optimal order quantity is where the probability of selling everything ordered (the service level) equals the ratio of the underage cost (Cu) to the total of the underage and overage costs (Cu + Co).

1. **Understand and Define the Costs:**

- The selling price per unit is $11.
- The ordering (overage) cost per unsold item is $4.
- To find the underage cost (Cu), subtract the cost from the selling price. Unfortunately, the cost to buy the item isn't provided, but typically, Cu is calculated as (Selling Price - Purchase Price). Since Purchase Price isn't given, let's assume the profit margin is embedded in the overage cost calculation for simplicity. Thus, we directly use the selling price as a proxy for Cu, which is $11 in this context. This simplification may alter the traditional calculation but is the closest we can proceed with the given data.

2. **Calculate the Ratio of Cu to (Cu+Co):**

Given:
- Cu (the cost of underestimating demand) = $11 (considering it as the profit lost for each unit under-ordered, due to lack of purchasing cost info).
- Co (the cost of overestimating demand, i.e., the overage cost) = $4.

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{Cu}{Cu+Co} = \frac{11}{11+4} = \frac{11}{15} = 0.73 \]

This ratio represents the service level, meaning the probability of selling all units ordered should be 73% to optimize the balance between overage and underage costs.

3. **Analyze Historical Demand:**

From the provided data tuples (Order Quantity, Observed Demand), let's organize the demand:

- [(12, 12), (16, 16), (13, 10), (18, 13)]

We can ignore days where demand met or exceeded supply since this tells us the probability of selling everything we order. We instead focus on understanding the pattern and probability distributions of demands to find a percentile that would match our target service level of 73%.

However, with such a small sample size, exact statistical measures like variance and standard deviation might be less reliable. But, we should aim to find an estimated order quantity that could result in achieving sales in 73% of the cases based on historical demand, which looks like selecting a demand level that 73% of the past demands do not exceed.

Demand data: [12, 16, 10, 13]

To estimate the demand level corresponding to a 73% service level, we should organize the demand values in ascending order and select a value close to the 73rd percentile.

Sorted Demand: [10, 12, 13, 16]

Given that we have four observations, the 73% service level falls between the 3rd (75th percentile, closest to 73%) and the 2nd observation (50th percentile). But since our ideal should match or be slightly higher than the 73% desired level, leaning toward the demand figure close to or at the 75th percentile would be more appropriate.

**Deduction:**
Based on the sorted demand, choosing a unit close to or slightly higher than the 3rd demand value (13) should align closely with a service level of 73%. Since the 3rd value itself is 13 and the 4th is 16, and you want to optimize for a 73% service level closely, opting for a value that represents a high probability of selling all units ordered becomes critical.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the simplistic method approached due to data constraints and to align closely with the calculated service level of 73%, the optimal quantity to order, based on the given data, seems most logically to be just above 13, considering we want to increase the chance to meet or exceed the 73% service level slightly.

**Optimal Order Quantity for the Next Day:**

4,3,"[(14, 13), (13, 10), (10, 10), (12, 6)]",8.196956325,10.77989037,12,10,1,"The Newsboy Problem, or single-period inventory problem, is an approach to manage inventory and determine the optimal amount of a product to order for a subsequent period, taking into consideration the unpredictability of demand. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes the costs associated with ordering too much or too little. 

In the newsboy model, the cost of underordering (the cost of lost sales, or underage cost) is derived from the difference between the selling price and the cost price per unit. The cost of overordering (overage cost) is given directly as the ordering cost per unit. 

Given data: [(14, 13), (13, 10), (10, 10), (12, 6)]
Selling price per unit = 11
Ordering cost (overage cost) = 4

Step 1: Determine the underage cost (Cu)
The underage cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which, in this scenario, is not explicitly stated. Since only the selling price and the overage cost are provided, we'll use the selling price in our calculations for the potential profit lost when not ordering enough. Therefore, Cu = selling price - cost price. But without the cost price, a common approach is to consider the selling price as a proxy for the lost opportunity, yielding Cu â‰?11 (acknowledging that this simplification may affect the accuracy of our calculation).

Step 2: Calculate the critical ratio (CR)
The critical ratio (CR) is calculated using the formula CR = Cu / (Cu + Co), where Co is the overage cost. Here, Cu = 11 and Co = 4, so:
\[CR = \frac{11}{11 + 4} = \frac{11}{15} = 0.7333\]

Step 3: Estimate demand probability distribution
To apply the CR, we need to estimate the demand probability distribution from the historical data. The provided data points are not sufficient to form a comprehensive distribution but give us an idea of demand variability. The demands observed are 13, 10, 10, and 6.

Step 4: Determine the optimal order quantity
The optimal order quantity will correspond to the demand level at or just above our critical ratio in the cumulative probability distribution of demand. Without a detailed distribution, we'll align this CR to the relative frequencies from our sparse data as a proxy, understanding this methodâ€™s limitations.

Given the limited data set, letâ€™s assume a simplistic approach to estimating which quantity closely matches or exceeds the critical ratio:

- 6 (observed once, too low), 
- 10 (observed twice, might be closer but still might underrepresent true demand), 
- 13 (observed once, closer to but might overrepresent demand given our limited data).

To decide without an exact distribution, we aim for a quantity that minimizes the risk of overage and underage. While the exact matching of CR to a demand probability is not feasible here, a decision must lean towards maximizing expected profit considering the cost dynamics.

Given the nature of the Newsboy problem, aligning the precise order quantity to a calculated critical ratio without concrete demand probabilities is a bit speculative. But in general, given the observed demand instances and our CR, an intermediate quantity that moderately risks overage for the potential of reaching or slightly exceeding average demand may be advisable.

So, considering the data at hand and aiming to position the order quantity around or slightly above the median or most frequent demand (given the CR suggests a higher tolerance for overstocking than understocking):

Optimal order quantity for the next day:

4,4,"[(13, 4), (14, 8), (9, 7), (8, 4)]",9.285281716,11.59012384,6,7,7,"The newsboy (or newsvendor) model is used to determine the optimal order quantity given the costs associated with ordering too little or too much. In this case, we have a selling price per unit and an overage cost (the cost of ordering too much), which are $11 and $4, respectively. The model doesn't directly account for the ordering cost, but it considers the overage cost and the underordering cost (the missed profit opportunity, calculated as the selling price minus the overage cost).

First, we calculate the critical ratio (CR), which is the cost of underestimating demand (Cu) divided by the total cost of misestimation (Co + Cu), where:
- Cu is the cost of underestimation, equal to the selling price minus the ordering cost ($11 - $4 = $7).
- Co is the overage cost, which is $4.

Thus, CR = Cu / (Cu + Co) = $7 / ($7 + $4) = 7 / 11 â‰?0.6364.

The critical ratio tells us the proportion of times the actual demand should be less than the order quantity to minimize costs. So, we need to find a demand level where approximately 63.64% of the observed demands are less than or equal to this demand level.

Next, we analyze the provided demand data to fit this criterion. The demand numbers in the data set are [4, 8, 7, 4]. First, let's sort these demands: [4, 4, 7, 8].

To determine the optimal order quantity, we want the cumulative probability of each demand level being less than or equal to the critical ratio. However, since we're dealing with discrete demand instances instead of a continuous probability distribution, we approximate by finding a demand level near where about 63.64% of the demand occurrences would be less than or equal.

Let's examine the demand frequencies:
- Demand of 4: 2 occurrences
- Demand of 7: 1 occurrence
- Demand of 8: 1 occurrence

The total number of observations is 4. If we order for a demand of 4, we cover 50% of the observations, which is less than our critical ratio. If we order for a demand of 7, we cover 75% (3 out of 4 observations), surpassing the CR. Since there's no demand quantity that exactly matches the CR due to the discrete nature of our data, the decision point lies between the demand of 4 and 7.

Given the options, ordering for a demand of 7 is closer to our calculated critical ratio, considering we aim to not exceed the CR to minimize the combined costs of overaging and underage.

1. **Determine the Underage and Overage Costs:**
    - Selling Price (P) = $11
    - Cost per unit (C) = $4
    - Underage cost (Cu) = Selling Price - Cost per unit = $11 - $4 = $7
    - Overage cost (Co) = Cost per unit = $4

3. **Gather the Demand Data:**
   From the tuples [(15, 6), (9, 7), (11, 11), (7, 6)], extracting the demand values gives us [6, 7, 11, 6].

   - P(Demand â‰?11) = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.0

6. **Find the Optimal Order Quantity (Q*):**
   The cumulative probability closest to, but not less than, the critical ratio (0.63636) suggests an optimal order quantity. In this case, the cumulative probability that first exceeds the critical ratio is for demand of 6 (with a cumulative probability of 0.5) and then for demand of 7 (with a cumulative probability of 0.75).

   Since 0.75 is the first cumulative probability to exceed our critical ratio of 0.63636, we use the demand level associated with it to find our optimal order quantity. Hence, the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model based on our demand data is the demand that matches or closely exceeds the cumulative probability of 0.63636, which is **7**.

7. **Conclusion:**
   Considering the steps above and looking at the critical ratio with respect to our cumulative probabilities, we deduce that ordering to meet the demand of 7 units optimizes the balance between the cost of overage and the opportunity lost due to underage.

The data points are tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day: [(9, 8), (12, 7), (8, 8), (7, 7)].

### Step 1: Understand the model parameters
- Selling price per unit (\(p\)) = $11
- Ordering cost per unit (overage cost) (\(c\)) = $4
- Thus, the salvage value or the underordering cost per unit (\(s\)) can be considered as \(p - c\), which is $7.

### Step 2: Calculate the ratio for the critical ratio (CR)
To determine the optimal order quantity, the newsboy model uses the critical ratio (CR), which is the ratio of the underordering cost to the sum of the overordering cost and underordering cost.
\[ CR = \frac{(p - c)}{(p - c) + (c)} = \frac{s}{(p-c) + c} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

### Step 3: Analyze demand data to find the optimal order quantity
The critical fraction or ratio guides us towards the optimal inventory level, which we need to match with our empirical demand distribution percentile that corresponds to the CR. In other words, we seek to order a quantity such that the probability of selling all units (demand being greater than or equal to the order quantity) is approximately 0.636.

Given the demand observations are 8, 7, 8, and 7, we first rank these demands in increasing order: 7, 7, 8, 8.

### Step 4: Find the percentile rank closest to the CR in the demand data
Since we have an even number of observations, we need to interpolate to find the demand value closest to our CR of approximately 0.636.

- The total number of observations (\(N\)) is 4. Thus the \(CR \times N = 0.636 \times 4 = 2.544\). This suggests looking between the 2nd and 3rd observations after sorting the demand.

Given our sorted demand, the 2nd value is 7, and the 3rd value is 8.

### Step 5: Interpolate to find the optimal order quantity
Because the CR value falls between the 2nd and 3rd observations, we interpolate between the demands of 7 and 8. However, given the nature of this simple distribution and the purpose of optimal ordering, we lean towards the higher of the two to meet our CR requirement closely.

Hence, considering the requirement for a high probability (about 63.6%) of selling all units ordered and the data distribution, the optimal order quantity would lean towards 8, as this matches our requirement for the critical ratio and is conservative compared to stepping outside our observed demands.

### Conclusion
The process outlined uses the newsboy model to determine the optimal ordering quantity based on historical data, a given selling price, and an overage cost. It aims to balance the cost of ordering too much against the cost of not ordering enough.

4,7,"[(25, 9), (16, 9), (20, 5), (19, 3)]",7.465981875,17.21210806,7,9,9,"To find the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the given historical order and demand data, we need to follow several steps. The newsboy model, also known as the newsvendor model, is used to determine the optimal inventory level for a single-period inventory problem. It balances the cost of having too much inventory (overage cost) against the cost of having too little inventory (underage cost), given the uncertainty in demand. In this scenario, the overage cost is the ordering cost which is $4 per unit, and the underage cost is the opportunity cost of losing a sale, which is the selling price minus the ordering cost ($11 - $4 = $7 per unit).

Here are the given tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day: [(25, 9), (16, 9), (20, 5), (19, 3)].

**Step 1: Compute the probability distribution of demand**

From the tuples, we can see the observed demands are 9, 9, 5, and 3. To calculate the probability distribution of these demands, we first list each unique demand value and the number of times it occurs:

- Demand of 3 occurs 1 time
- Demand of 5 occurs 1 time
- Demand of 9 occurs 2 times

So, the probabilities are:
- P(Demand=3) = 1/4
- P(Demand=5) = 1/4
- P(Demand=9) = 2/4 = 1/2

**Step 2: Calculate the critical ratio (CR)**

The critical ratio is the ratio between the underage cost and the total cost (underage cost plus overage cost): CR = Underage Cost / (Underage Cost + Overage Cost)

In this case, the underage cost is $7 (selling price - ordering cost), and the overage cost is $4. So, CR = 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11 â‰?0.6364.

**Step 3: Determine the optimal order quantity**

The optimal order quantity is the smallest quantity for which the cumulative probability of demand is equal to or just exceeds the critical ratio. With our probabilities computed in Step 1, let's calculate the cumulative probabilities:

- Cumulative probability of demand â‰?3: 1/4 = 0.25
- Cumulative probability of demand â‰?5: 1/4 + 1/4 = 0.5
- Cumulative probability of demand â‰?9: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/2 = 1.0

Given our critical ratio of approximately 0.6364, we find the optimal demand to be the smallest demand with a cumulative probability exceeding 0.6364, which corresponds to a demand of 9 units (since the cumulative probability of demand â‰?9 is 1.0, and this is the first point where cumulative probability exceeds CR).

**Final Step: Output the optimal order quantity**

Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day, according to the newsboy model, would be:

4,8,"[(4, 4), (4, 0), (5, 3), (5, 2)]",1.754233898,4.890517304,3,3,3,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the **newsboy model** (also known as the **newsvendor model**), we'll follow a specific process. This model helps in finding the balance point where the costs of ordering too much (overage cost) and ordering too little (underage cost) are closest to each other. The optimal order quantity minimizes the expected total cost or maximizes the expected profit.

Given data:
- Selling price = 11
- Ordering cost (overage cost) = 4
- Data: [(4, 4), (4, 0), (5, 3), (5, 2)]

First, let's define the terms used in the newsvendor model:
- **Cu** (underage cost): The difference between the selling price and the cost price. Since the cost price isnâ€™t directly given, itâ€™s implied in the overage cost. However, for this problem, since we're only given the selling price and the ordering cost, we consider the underage cost as being the lost profit for not having enough inventory, hence Selling Price - Ordering Cost.
- **Co** (overage cost): The cost of ordering one unit too many, which is given as 4.

To compute the optimal order quantity, we first calculate the Cu:
\[Cu = Selling\ Price - Ordering\ Cost = 11 - 4 = 7\]

Next, we find the critical ratio (\(CR\)), which is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs:
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

The critical ratio represents the service level, or the probability of not running out of stock. To use this critical ratio to find the optimal order quantity, we need to look at the historical demand and sort it to find the demand level at which the cumulative probability is as close as possible to CR.

Historical demands from provided data are: 4, 0, 3, 2. First, let's organize these demands in ascending order: 0, 2, 3, 4. 

Next, we calculate the empirical cumulative probability distribution of demand. Since we have 4 observations:

- For demand â‰?0: 1/4
- For demand â‰?2: 2/4
- For demand â‰?3: 3/4
- For demand â‰?4: 4/4

Our goal is to find where our CR (7/11 or approximately 0.636) fits within these cumulative probabilities. 

Looking at the cumulative probabilities:
- The cumulative probability just before reaching or exceeding 0.636 is for demand â‰?2 (2/4 or 0.5).
- The next cumulative probability is for demand â‰?3 (3/4 or 0.75).

Since our CR (0.636) falls between these two points, and since we prefer not to stock out, we lean towards the demand level associated with the next highest cumulative probability that exceeds our CR, suggesting an optimal demand level to meet or slightly exceed is 3.

Given this analysis, the optimal order quantity based on the newsvendor model and the provided historical order and demand data is:

This model helps manage the supply of perishable goods, addressing the balance between having too much and too little stock. The key is to minimize the risk of overstocking while avoiding understocking, considering the cost of unsold goods and the potential profit from sales.

### Step-by-Step Process Using the Newsboy Model

#### 1. Understand the Variables:
- **Selling Price (P)**: 11 per unit
- **Ordering Cost or Overage Cost (C)**: 4 per unit
- **Observed Past Data**: [(15, 5), (13, 7), (19, 8), (25, 10)]
  - Each tuple is (Order Quantity, Demand)

#### 2. Identify the Critical Ratio:
The critical ratio (CR) is key in the newsboy model, calculating the proportion of demand we aim to meet without overstocking. It's defined as:

\[ CR = \frac{P - C}{P} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} \]

Thus, the critical ratio is approximately 0.6364.

#### 3. Analyze Historical Demand:
To apply the critical ratio, we need a good understanding of historical demand. From our dataset, the demands are 5, 7, 8, and 10.

#### 4. Use the Critical Ratio to Determine Optimal Order Quantity:
The optimal order quantity is the demand level that matches or closely matches the critical ratio when looking at the distribution of past demands. Essentially, we want the probability \( P(\text{Demand} \leq Q) \leq CR \) to be true, where \(Q\) is the optimal order quantity.

Given the demands (5, 7, 8, 10), we must find where our \(CR\) fits within the distribution of these demands. Since \(CR\) is 0.6364, we look for the demand value that matches or is the closest to this percentage when comparing the observed demand probabilities.

#### 5. Calculate Demand Probabilities:
Assuming each observed demand has equal probability since no other information is provided, the probabilities for each observed demand level are:

\[ \text{Probability of Demand} = \frac{1}{\text{Number of Different Demands Observed}} = \frac{1}{4} \]

However, what we actually need to match with the critical ratio is the cumulative probability distribution to find where our CR fits.

#### 6. Cumulative Probability Distribution and Matching with CR:
- The cumulative distribution of demands being less than or equal to each observed demand gives us intervals. For simplicity, we average or linearly interpolate but ideally would look for the exact fit or utilize empirical distribution.
  
  Given demands are fairly evenly spread, we could argue about inserting CR in an intuitive manner, but let's proceed with identifying demand most closely fitting CR without explicit cumulative probabilities due to data limitations.

#### 7. Judging by the Given Data:
- Direct matching isn't possible without assuming a more detailed distribution, but for practical purposes and based on provided data, we choose a demand value that intuitively aligns with our CR. Given the small dataset and equal weighting, we look for a demand roughly in the 63.64 percentile. This places our target demand between 7 and 8 if we were interpolating linearly.

### Conclusion:
Given the steps above and the limitations in precisely pinpointing an optimal order quantity due to the simplistic and small dataset, we approximate based on CR and observed demands. Since we aim for a demand level at or slightly above the 63.64 percentile and our demands are 5, 7, 8, 10, the optimal order quantity is slightly above 7 but less than 8 for a small dataset interpretation.

Considering practical rounding and the nature of inventory, it's effective to choose the higher nearest whole number (to minimize the risk of understocking) when in between values:

4,10,"[(15, 1), (9, 0), (6, 2), (8, 3)]",3.504264871,13.02651419,2,2,*,"To apply the newsboy (or newsvendor) model to determine the optimal order quantity from the provided data, follow these steps:

### 1. **Understand the Model Basis**

The newsboy model is used to find the optimal level of inventory that balances the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) vs. the cost of ordering too little (underage cost). The key formula for the newsboy model considers the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs:

\[Optimal\ Stock\ Level = F^{-1}\left(\frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\right)\]

Where:
- \(F^{-1}\) represents the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for demand.
- \(Cu\) is the cost of understocking (underage cost), equal to the selling price minus the cost per unit.
- \(Co\) is the cost of overstocking (overage cost), given directly by the ordering cost in this case.

### 2. **Calculate Cu and Co**

Given:
- Selling Price = $11
- Ordering Cost (Overage Cost) = $4

Thus:
- \(Cu\) = Selling Price - Cost per Unit = $11 - $4 = $7
- \(Co\) = $4

### 3. **Determine the Demand Distribution**

The demands observed are [1, 0, 2, 3]. To apply the newsboy model, we usually need a continuous or well-defined discrete demand distribution to find \(F^{-1}\), the inverse CDF. However, with such limited data, we'll create a simple distribution from the observed demands.

### 4. **Calculate the Probability Distribution of Demand**

From the given data, the probabilities are:
- P(Demand=0) = 1/4
- P(Demand=1) = 1/4
- P(Demand=2) = 1/4
- P(Demand=3) = 1/4

### 5. **Compute the Optimal Stock Level Ratio**

The ratio for the optimal stock level (\(F^{-1}\)) calculation is:
\[Ratio = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636\]

### 6. **Find the Optimal Order Quantity (Q\*)**

To determine \(Q^*\), we need to find where the cumulative probability of demand is just greater than or equal to 0.636. Given our simplistic model, we incrementally add the probabilities of demand until we meet or exceed this threshold.

- Cumulative probability up to demand=0: 1/4
- Up to demand=1: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2
- Up to demand=2: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4

### 7. **Result**

Since the cumulative probability equals or exceeds 0.636 after the demand of 2 (at 3/4), the optimal order quantity to cover this probability is for a demand of 2 plus a little more to align with our demand exceeding this threshold, which suggests ordering for a demand of 3 would be more apt as the newsboy model suggests ordering up to the point where the cumulative probability is just exceeded. 

However, considering the small sample size and the simplistic approach to demand distribution estimation, this calculation has its limitations but serves as an indicative process for using the newsboy model.

4,11,"[(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1), (4, 4)]",8.131280488,4.567106223,19,3,3,"To utilize the newsboy model (also known as the newsvendor model) to deduce the optimal order quantity for the given data, we follow a structured approach. The newsboy model optimizes the order quantity to balance the costs of overage (ordering too much) and underage (ordering too little) relative to the actual demand. The given parameters include tuples representing daily order quantities and observed demands, as well as the selling price and the ordering (overage) cost. Step by step, here's how to proceed:

### 1. Calculate the Critical Ratio
To find the optimal order quantity, we first need to calculate the critical ratio (CR). The critical ratio is defined as the ratio of the cost of underordering (Cu) to the total cost (Cu + Co), where Cu is the cost of underordering per unit, and Co is the overage cost per unit.

Given: 
- Selling price per unit = 11
- Ordering (overage) cost per unit = 4

To calculate Cu (cost of underordering per unit), subtract the overage cost from the selling price: Cu = Selling price - Overage cost = 11 - 4 = 7.

Thus, the critical ratio (CR) is:
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

### 2. Calculate the Probability of Demand Being at or Below a Certain Level
Given the observed demand from our historical data [(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1), (4, 4)], we can calculate the probability distribution of demand.
- The demand levels observed: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The probabilities of each demand level occurring given our historical sample are all equal to \(1/4\) or 0.25 since each appears once in our data set.

### 3. Deduce the Optimal Order Quantity
To find the optimal order quantity, we aim to choose a Q such that the probability of demand being less than or equal to Q is as close as possible to the critical ratio, without going below it. The critical ratio here is \(7/11\) or approximately 0.636.

From the probabilities:
- P(Demand â‰?1) = 0.25
- P(Demand â‰?2) = 0.50
- P(Demand â‰?3) = 0.75
- P(Demand â‰?4) = 1.00

The critical ratio of approximately 0.636 falls between the probabilities of demand being less than or equal to 2 and 3. Since we aim to choose a Q where the probability of demand being less than or equal to Q is as close as possible to the CR but not below it, the optimal order quantity is where P(Demand â‰?Q) â‰?CR for the smallest such Q.

Given that P(Demand â‰?2) = 0.50 and P(Demand â‰?3) = 0.75, the optimal order quantity is the first Q where P(Demand â‰?Q) is just over the CR, which is when Q = 3.

4,12,"[(19, 7), (16, 1), (24, 3), (18, 4)]",3.358423169,18.50305479,4,4,*,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model, we'll follow a systematic approach. This model is particularly useful for products that cannot be sold after a certain period, and it aims to balance the costs associated with underordering and overordering.

### Step 1: Understand the Model's Key Inputs

- **Selling Price (P):** \$11
- **Ordering Cost or Overage Cost (C):** \$4
- **Salvage Value (V):** Typically, the salvage value is considered when unsold items can be sold at a lower price. However, given the information, it appears there's no salvage value, or it's equal to the ordering cost, which means overage cost directly translates to loss.
- **Demand and Order Quantity Data:** A set of pairs showing daily demand and order quantity. In this case, [(19, 7), (16, 1), (24, 3), (18, 4)].

### Step 2: Determine the Model's Critical Ratio

The critical ratio (CR) is a key part of determining the optimal order quantity. It is calculated using the formula:

\[
CR = \frac{P - C}{P - V}
\]

Since it seems we're treating unsold items as a total loss (implying V = C or V = 0 with our direct loss being the overage cost C), the formula simplifies to:

\[
CR = \frac{P - C}{P} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability Distribution of Demand

To use the newsboy model effectively, we need to estimate the likelihood of different demand levels. Given our limited dataset, we approximate this by calculating the frequency of observed demand levels.

Our demands in the dataset are 7, 1, 3, and 4. To get a meaningful probability distribution, we would ideally look at a wider range of data to understand how often each demand level occurs. However, with our limited set, we proceed by calculating empirical probabilities or use these data points to infer general demand trends.

### Step 4: Determine the Demand Level that Matches the Critical Ratio

This step typically involves finding the demand level (Q) where the cumulative probability is just above the critical ratio CR. Given our simplified approach and limited data, we'll not precisely calculate cumulative probabilities but understand the need to order according to a demand level that closely matches or exceeds CR.

### Output

Given the constraints and simplifications in our analysis, a detailed probability distribution and cumulative probability analysis cannot be accurately conducted with the provided data alone. However, the overall goal in the newsboy model is to balance the risk of overordering against the risk of underordering based on CR.

Given the cost structure and the small dataset provided, if we were to provide a simplified estimate or decide an optimal order quantity without detailed demand probability distribution, it would be based more on intuition and less on precise calculations using the Newsboy model framework.

Since detailed demand probabilities cannot be accurately calculated, and recognizing our aim is to closely match demand to optimally balance costs, we would aim to supply an order quantity that historically matches or is slightly above our lower observed demand to ensure we are close to our critical ratio. This ensures we are being conservative given both overage and underordering implications.

Given the limited data and the necessity for a numerical response based on the provided methodology context:

4,13,"[(5, 5), (14, 12), (14, 8), (10, 6)]",5.551474432,9.954138249,10,8,*,"The newsboy (or newsvendor) model is used to determine the optimal inventory level for perishable or one-time-use products, where demand is uncertain. The model balances the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too little (underage cost). The goal is to find the order quantity that maximizes expected profit or minimizes the total cost.

Given:
- Selling price per unit = $11
- Ordering (overage) cost per unit = $4
- Underage cost per unit = Selling price - Ordering cost = $11 - $4 = $7

We have historic data in the form of tuples representing the order quantity and observed demand for each day: \[(5, 5), (14, 12), (14, 8), (10, 6)\]

### Step 1: Calculate the probability distribution of demand
First, we observe the demand quantities: 5, 12, 8, 6. To calculate the probability distribution, we can count how many times each demand appears and divide by the total number of observations. However, since each demand is unique in our small sample, we calculate probabilities based on these unique values.

### Step 2: Determine the Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio is calculated as the ratio of underage cost to the sum of underage and overage costs.
\[ CR = \frac{Underage\, Cost}{Underage\, Cost + Overage\, Cost} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

### Step 3: Find the Service Level and Optimal Order Quantity
The critical ratio essentially represents the service levelâ€”how often you meet demand without stocking out. We aim to find the demand level at which the cumulative probability equals or just exceeds the CR.

Given the small dataset and its variability, we direct our focus towards determining a cumulative probability distribution rather than identifying a perfect match. In a more detailed analysis, we would calculate the cumulative distribution of demand and then find where it meets or exceeds the CR value. For simplicity, and given we can't calculate exact probabilities here without more data, we consider the notion that the optimal service level matches or slightly exceeds our CR calculation. 

Since we don't have a detailed probability distribution, we can't apply the exact methodology as prescribed by the newsboy model. Instead, we'll infer the best approach based on the provided data:

- Observing demand, it varies from 5 to 12 units.
- Our CR suggests we aim for a high service level (7/11 or approximately 63.64%).

In real-world application, one would calculate the cumulative probability for each demand level and then select the smallest demand quantity at which the cumulative probability is equal to or just above 63.64%. Without an exact distribution, this step necessitates approximation based on available data.

For example:
- If we observe that demands lower than 8 happen 50% of the time and demands of 8 or higher occur 50% of the time, we might choose to order at least 8 units given our CR suggests aiming to satisfy roughly 63.64% of demand. 

Given we're working with an approximation:
- Order quantities in historical data ranged from 5 to 14 units. 
- Demand showed considerable variation.

With the intent to closely align with the critical ratio without exact demand probabilities, we consider leaning towards the middle to upper part of the observed demand range to formulate a more responsive strategy.

### Conclusion
Given the limited data and absence of a precise cumulative probability distribution, identifying the optimal order quantity exactly as per the newsboy model directives is challenging. However, considering the balance between not overstocking (with a relatively lower overage cost of $4) while aiming to meet a significant portion of demand (service level aligned with CR), a midpoint in observed demand values, slightly adjusted towards the higher end to match our service level insight, might serve as a practical approximation.

So, concluding with a focus on balancing the observed demands and the critical ratio insight:

4,14,"[(5, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 2)]",2.690305018,3.46689566,3,2,2,"To deduce the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model from the provided data, we'll follow a structured approach. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. **Understanding Key Terms**:
   - **Selling Price (p)**: The profit from selling one unit, which is $11.
   - **Ordering Cost (c)**: The cost of ordering one unit, also known as the overage cost, which is $4.
   - **Salvage Value (v)**: Although not explicitly provided, the salvage value (in case of unsold stock) is generally less than the ordering cost. Here, it's implied to be $0 as unsold units' value isn't mentioned.
   - **Cu (Cost of Understocking)**: The cost of understocking is the lost profit from not meeting demand, which is p - c = $11 - $4 = $7.
   - **Co (Cost of Overstocking)**: The cost of overstocking is the difference between the ordering cost and the salvage value, which here is simply c = $4 since the salvage value is implied to be $0.

2. **Calculate the Service Level (SL)**:
   The service level is the probability of not running out of stock, and can be calculated using the formula:
   \[ SL = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[ SL = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

3. **Analyze Historical Demand**:
   The demands from the given tuples are [4, 2, 1, 2]. To decide the optimal order quantity, we need to know at what cumulative probability our service level (SL) falls to determine our target order quantity.

4. **Calculate Cumulative Probability Distribution of Demand**:
   First, sort the demands in ascending order: [1, 2, 2, 4].
   Then, calculate the cumulative probability for each demand level. Given the small sample size, we can treat each unique demand level as having the following probabilities:
   - Demand 1: 1 out of 4 days or 0.25 cumulative probability.
   - Demand 2: 3 out of 4 days or (1 + 2 out of 4) 0.75 cumulative probability.
   - Demand 4: 4 out of 4 days or 1.00 cumulative probability.

5. **Find Optimal Order Quantity**:
   We are looking for the demand level at or just above our service level of approximately 0.6364. From our cumulative probabilities:
   - For Demand of 1, the cumulative probability is 0.25.
   - For Demand of 2, the cumulative probability is 0.75.

   Hence, the optimal order quantity is the first level where the cumulative probability exceeds the service level, which in this case corresponds to a demand of 2.

6. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the newsboy model and the provided data, the optimal order quantity for the next day to maximize performance while limiting risk of overage and underage costs is:

The model aims to balance the costs between ordering too much and not ordering enough.

### Step 1: Define the Parameters
- **Selling Price per Unit (P)**: $11
- **Ordering Cost per Unit (Co)**: $4
- We're given historical order and demand data in tuples representing order quantity and observed demand: [(24, 9), (8, 8), (16, 10), (15, 9)].

### Step 2: Calculate Underage and Overage Costs
- **Underage Cost (Cu)**: This is the cost of ordering too little, which equals the selling price minus the ordering cost: Cu = P - Co = $11 - $4 = $7 per unit. This is the profit lost for each unit underordered.
- **Overage Cost (Co)**: This is given as the ordering cost, which is $4 per unit. This is the cost for each unit overordered.

### Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The CR is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of underage and overage costs: 
\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} \]
\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

### Step 4: Determine the Optimal Service Level (OSL)
The optimal service level is the probability of not running out of stock or the probability that demand is less than or equal to our order quantity, which aligns with the critical ratio (CR). Thus, the OSL is approximately 0.636 or 63.6%.

### Step 5: Analyze Historical Demand Data
From the provided tuples, we can extract the demand data: [9, 8, 10, 9]. We need to determine at what order quantity the historical probability of demand being less than or equal to that quantity matches or closely matches the OSL of 63.6%.

### Step 6: Calculate the Probability Distribution of Demand
Count how many times each demand level occurs and divide by the total number of events to get the probability. 

The demand frequencies are: 
- 8 occurs 1/4 times.
- 9 occurs 2/4 times.
- 10 occurs 1/4 times.

### Step 7: Determine the Cumulative Probability Distribution of Demand
- Probability(Demand â‰?8) = 1/4 = 0.25
- Probability(Demand â‰?9) = 1/4 (for â‰?) + 2/4 (for 9) = 3/4 = 0.75
- Probability(Demand â‰?10) = 1 (since this is the maximum observed demand)

### Step 8: Decide the Optimal Order Quantity
We're looking for a Cumulative Probability Distribution closest to the OSL (63.6%). The cumulative probability of demanding 9 units is 0.75, which is the closest to our OSL of 63.6%.

### Conclusion
Thus, according to the newsboy model and the critical ratio derived from the given costs and historical demand data, the optimal order quantity for the next day would be closest to when the cumulative demand probability matches our OSL.

4,16,"[(14, 4), (11, 8), (8, 8), (22, 5)]",5.972062657,16.03867069,8,8,*,"To deduce the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model, given your historical data: \([(14, 4), (11, 8), (8, 8), (22, 5)]\), with a selling price of 11 and an ordering cost (overage cost) of 4, we'll follow these steps:

### 1. Understand the Newsboy Model Basics
The newsboy model is used to find the optimal level of inventory to order that minimizes the costs associated with inventory under- and over-stocking. The key to the model is balancing the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too little (underage cost).

The formula for the **critical ratio (Cr)** in the newsboy model is given by:

\[Cr = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\]

Where:
- \(Cu\) is the underage cost, which is the lost profit per unit when demand exceeds the order quantity. Here, it's the selling price minus the ordering cost: \(11 - 4 = 7\).
- \(Co\) is the overage cost, which is given directly as 4.

### 2. Calculate the Critical Ratio
Given \(Cu = 7\) and \(Co = 4\), we can calculate the critical ratio \((Cr)\):

\[Cr = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636\]

### 3. Analyze Historical Demand Data
To determine the optimal order quantity, we need to understand the distribution of demand. From your data, the demands observed were 4, 8, 8, and 5.

### 4. Calculate the Probability Distribution for Demand
We need to convert observed demands into a probability distribution to compare against the critical ratio. For simplicity, we detect probabilities by the frequency of each demand level in the data set.

- **Demand of 4**: \(1/4 = 0.25\)
- **Demand of 5**: \(1/4 = 0.25\)
- **Demand of 8**: \(2/4 = 0.5\)

### 5. Determine Optimal Order Quantity
The optimal order quantity is determined by finding the smallest quantity \(q\) that satisfies the condition \(P(Demand \leq q) \geq Cr\), where \(Cr\) is the critical ratio previously calculated.

- \(P(Demand \leq 4) = 0.25\) (Not enough, as \(0.25 < 0.636\)).
- \(P(Demand \leq 5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5\) (Still not enough).
- \(P(Demand \leq 8) = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 1\) (This exceeds the critical ratio, suggesting that an order quantity that matches or closely surpasses a demand of 8 units would be optimal).

Given this analysis, the optimal order quantity aligns with the demand level that first makes \(P(Demand \leq q) \geq Cr\), which in this case is 8 units. So, for the next order:

4,17,"[(4, 4), (13, 7), (12, 7), (8, 7)]",6.637306127,9.177422261,8,7,7,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model (also known as the Newsvendor model), we follow a process that accounts for the selling price, the ordering cost (overage cost), and the historical order and demand data. The data we have been provided is [(4, 4), (13, 7), (12, 7), (8, 7)], where each tuple represents (order quantity, observed demand) for each day.

### Step 1: Understand and Set Up the Model Parameters

- Selling price per unit (P) = $11
- Ordering cost per unit or overage cost (C) = $4
- Underage cost per unit (Cu) = P - C = $11 - $4 = $7

The overage cost is the cost of ordering one unit too many, and the underage cost is the loss incurred from ordering one unit too few (missed profit).

### Step 2: Determine the Critical Ratio (CR)

The critical ratio is given by the formula:

\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{P} = \frac{7}{11} \]

\[ CR \approx 0.6364 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability Distribution and Cumulative Probability of Demand

Given the demand data from the tuples, we need to estimate the demand probabilities. Although our dataset is small, it can give us an approximation. The demands observed are 4, 7, 7, 7.

- Demand for 4: 1 occurrence out of 4
- Demand for 7: 3 occurrences out of 4

So, the probability of demand being 4 is 0.25, and the probability of demand being 7 is 0.75.

### Step 4: Compare the Cumulative Probability with the Critical Ratio

To find the optimal order quantity, we compare cumulative probabilities with the CR:

- For demand of 4 (P=0.25), the cumulative probability is 0.25.
- For demand of 7 (P=0.75), the cumulative probability is 1.00.

### Step 5: Deduce the Optimal Order Quantity

We are looking for the smallest order quantity at which the cumulative probability exceeds or is equal to the CR. Since the CR is 0.6364:

- The cumulative probability for ordering 4 units is 0.25, which is below CR.
- When ordering 7 units, the cumulative probability is 0.75, which exceeds CR.

Hence, the optimal order quantity to meet or exceed the CR without significantly over-ordering is for the demand level which is just above the CR value, which in this case corresponds to a demand of 7.

4,18,"[(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 2)]",5.691173376,1.815167042,19,3,3,"To find the optimal order quantity for the next day using the provided historical order and demand data and the Newsvendor (newsboy) model, we follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Understand the Model and What We Know**
- **Selling Price** (\(p\)) = $11
- **Ordering Cost** (Overage Cost) (\(c\)) = $4
- **Data Points** = [(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 2)]

The Newsvendor model aims to balance the costs of ordering too little against the costs of ordering too much. The critical ratio in the model is defined as \( Cu / (Cu + Co) \), where \( Cu \) is the understock cost (selling price - cost) and \( Co \) is the overage cost (cost).

### **Step 2: Calculate Costs**
- **Understock Cost** (\(Cu\)) = \(p - c\) = $11 - $4 = $7

Since overage cost (\(Co\)) is given as the ordering cost, \(Co = c = $4\).

### **Step 3: Critical Ratio**
- **Critical Ratio** = \( Cu / (Cu + Co) \) = $7 / ($7 + $4) = $7 / $11 = 7/11

### **Step 4: Analyze Historical Data**
The historical data gives us the demand and order quantities. To use the Newsvendor model, we need to understand the demand distribution. From the data [(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 2)], we note that:

- Demand exactly meets the order quantity each day, suggesting a straightforward demand pattern where demand = order quantity.

But for deducing the optimal order quantity, we look at variability and demand patterns. Given the finite and perfectly matching dataset, it's challenging to abstract a probabilistic demand distribution directly. However, understanding the demand has so far matched the order suggests examining the service level (the critical ratio) against the demand could give us insights into the optimal quantity to order.

### **Step 5: Deduce Optimal Order Quantity**
Given the critical ratio of 7/11, which indicates the proportion of not wanting to incur understock costs, we aim to align our ordering to demand patterns that would most likely cover 7/11 of the selling opportunities without incurring overages. In this constrained example, demand equals the order each day, so our optimal order calculation might lean on finding a demand value that would likely respect our critical ratio.

Since the model and formula specifically cater to understanding and predicting demand-based on probabilistic outcomes, and our sample presents a direct demand = order scenario, the usual approach of leveraging the historical demand distribution to forecast or calculate a precise optimal order quantity is less straightforward.

However, if we interpret the instruction to deduce the order quantity for the next day strictly based on provided data and the critical ratio, without additional demand variability or distribution insights, we might consider maintaining an order quantity that closely matches the historical demand patterns. Given the limited variability and the perfect match of order and demand in the data provided, a deeper statistical analysis on optimal order quantity leans towards the observed average or a slightly adjusted value considering potential unseen demand trends or a strategic decision aligned with the critical ratio insights.

### **Output**
Given the context and constraints, one might choose to continue with an ordering strategy that aligns with observed demand while considering any nuanced strategic adjustments based on costs, critical ratio, or potential unseen variations in demand not captured in the sample.

**Optimal Order Quantity for Next Day:** 3"
4,19,"[(10, 8), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)]",7.950281343,8.144381401,10,5,],"To calculate the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the provided data, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Understanding the Newsboy Model

The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory model, is used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the cost of inventory. It takes into account the balance between two costs:
- The cost of overordering (overage cost) which is the loss from unsold items. This is given as $4 in your case.
- The cost of underordering (underage cost) which is the lost profit from having demand exceed supply. This is the selling price minus the cost price, but since only the selling price ($11) is provided, we'll consider the underage cost as the lost revenue from not making a sale, which is $11.

### Step 2: Calculate the Service Level (Critical Ratio)

The service level (or critical ratio, \(CR\)) is calculated by the formula \(CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\), where \(Cu\) is the cost of understocking (underage cost) per unit, and \(Co\) is the cost of overstocking (overage cost) per unit.

Given:
- \(Cu = 11\) (selling price, assuming all the cost here is the potential profit lost on each sale not made)
- \(Co = 4\) (ordering cost or overage cost per unit)

Plugging in the values,
\[CR = \frac{11}{11 + 4} = \frac{11}{15}\]
\[CR = 0.7333\]

### Step 3: Applying the Service Level to Determine Optimal Order Quantity

The critical ratio tells us the probability at which the expected demand should be less than or equal to our order quantity to maximize profit and minimize costs.

Next, we compare this critical ratio to our historical demand data to find the optimal order quantity. First, sort the demand data (in the provided tuples, the second value) in ascending order: \[3, 4, 5, 8\]

Now, we determine the cumulative distribution of demand. With four data points, the probabilities for each equal increments of \(1/4\) or \(0.25\), starting from \(0.25\) for the lowest demand and incrementing by \(0.25\) for each subsequent demand level. So, the cumulative probabilities are: \[0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0\]

### Step 4: Matching the Service Level to Demand

We look for the point in our cumulative distribution where the demand's cumulative probability matches or just exceeds our critical ratio of \(0.7333\). In our cumulative probabilities, the value \(0.75\) is the first to exceed \(0.7333\), associated with a demand level of \(5\).

### Conclusion:

Given the calculation and the method of the newsboy model, the optimal order quantity for minimizing costs while meeting demand is closely associated with a demand level corresponding to a cumulative probability that meets or exceeds the service level.

Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day is:
\[5\]"
4,20,"[(8, 3), (14, 10), (8, 8), (7, 7)]",8.453327816,8.778615436,9,8,7,"Let's apply the newsboy model step by step to deduce the optimal order quantity for the next day using the provided historical order and demand data. The given data consists of tuples with the daily order quantity and the observed demand, along with the selling price of $11 and the ordering (overage) cost of $4. The newsboy model aims to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes profit while minimizing both overage and underage costs.

### Step 1: Calculate the Underage Cost
The underage cost (Cu) is the cost of underestimating demand. It can be calculated as the selling price minus the cost price. However, since we are only given the selling price and the overage cost, we can infer that the cost price (Co) is implicitly included in the overage cost. So,
\[Cu = Selling\ Price - Cost\ Price\]

In this case, since we lack direct information about the cost price and are not explicitly asked to calculate Cu in numerical terms, we'll emphasize the conceptual understanding that Cu represents the lost profit on each unit not sold due to underordering.

### Step 2: Calculate the Critical Ratio
The critical ratio (Cr) is the ratio of the underage cost to the total of the underage and overage costs. This will guide us in deciding the optimal order quantity. 
\[Cr = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co}\]

Given that the overage cost (Co) is $4 and assuming the Cu calculated conceptually without an explicit cost price, the **critical ratio** still needs to be calculated with specific values for Cu. However, the understanding of calculating \[Cr\] is that it determines the probability at which ordering one more item equals the cost of ordering too much to the cost of ordering too little.

### Step 3: Assess Demand Probability
To align with the newsboy model, we would ideally calculate or estimate the probability distribution of demand based on historical data. However, the short data set provides limited insight into a full distribution but gives us some daily demands to consider.

### Step 4: Find the Optimal Order Quantity
Given the limitations in calculating the exact underage cost (Cu) and consequently the critical ratio (Cr) without the cost price, we will instead focus on understanding demand from the data provided to infer the optimal order quantity. We notice from the data - [(8, 3), (14, 10), (8, 8), (7, 7)] - that our orders compared to demand have varied, and there are instances of exact matches and overordering.

A practical approach, in this case, would be to calculate the average or median demand based on the historical figures and use this as a basis for deciding the next day's order quantity. This does not strictly follow the theoretical calculation of the newsboy model due to missing data points, but it aligns with the intention of matching supply with demand as closely as possible.

Average demand = (3 + 10 + 8 + 7) / 4 = 7

Given this simplified approach, the average demand can serve as a guide for the next day's optimal order quantity in the absence of the explicit cost breakdown needed for a rigorous application of the newsboy model.

### Optimal Order Quantity for the Next Day:
7"
5,1,"[(10, 10), (7, 7), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)]",7.871516357,6.870145185,9,7,*,"The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory model, helps determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the cost or maximizes the profit when dealing with perishable goods or items with a limited selling period. The model considers the selling price per unit, the cost per unit, and the salvage value (if any) for unsold units. However, since no salvage value is provided in this problem, we'll assume the cost of overordering is the ordering cost, and the cost of underordering is the difference between the selling price and the ordering cost.

Given:
- Selling Price (\(P\)) = $11
- Ordering Cost (\(C\)) = $4
- No salvage value is provided, so, the cost of overage (\(Co\)) is the ordering cost, which is $4.

The cost of underage (\(Cu\)) is the lost profit for each unit not sold, which is the selling price (\(P\)) minus the ordering cost (\(C\)). So,
\[Cu = P - C = 11 - 4 = $7\]

Next, to apply the newsboy model, we calculate the critical ratio (\(Cr\)) as follows:
\[Cr = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \]

The critical ratio is approximately 0.636.

Now, using the provided tuples (order quantity, observed demand), we analyze the demand distribution:
The demands observed are: 10, 7, 5, 5, 4.

To determine the optimal order quantity, we need to find a point in the demand distribution where the probability of demand being less than or equal to the order quantity is close to the critical ratio.

The demand probabilities, based on the given data points, are as follows:
- Demand of 4: 1/5 (since it occurred once out of five observations)
- Demand of 5: 2/5 (occurred in two out of five)
- Demand of 7: 1/5
- Demand of 10: 1/5

Thus, the cumulative probability distribution is:
- P(Demand <= 4) = 1/5
- P(Demand <= 5) = 3/5 = 0.6
- P(Demand <= 7) = 4/5 = 0.8
- P(Demand <= 10) = 1

The optimal order quantity corresponds to the demand level where the cumulative probability is just equal to or greater than the critical ratio \(Cr\), which is approximately 0.636.

Observing the cumulative probabilities:
- To find a probability just greater than 0.636, we see that P(Demand <= 5) is 0.6, which is below the critical ratio, and P(Demand <= 7) is 0.8, which is just above.

Therefore, the optimal order quantity that matches the criteria for the highest expected profit, given our critical ratio, is closest to the demand with a cumulative probability just above 0.636.

5,2,"[(7, 5), (11, 2), (6, 2), (9, 2), (7, 2)]",2.035437826,7.718728255,3,2,7,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy (or newsvendor) model with the given data, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Newsboy Model**: The model seeks the optimal balance between ordering too little and ordering too much, minimizing the expected cost or maximizing expected profit. It involves the selling price per unit, the cost per unit, and the demand probability distribution.

2. **Given Information**:
   - Selling price per unit ($P$): 11
   - Ordering cost per unit ($C$): 4
   - The data: [(7, 5), (11, 2), (6, 2), (9, 2), (7, 2)]

3. **Calculate Critical Ratio (CR)**: The critical ratio is the probability of selling an item if you stock it. It's calculated as:
   $$ CR = \frac{P - C}{P} = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} $$

4. **Processing Demand Data**: Notice that we should predict the demand probability from the given data tuples. However, direct prediction from given tuples can be challenging without clear frequency data of demands. So, in this simplified scenario, it might make more sense to estimate demand or make assumptions based on what we know.

5. **Basic Demand Assumption**: Given the simplicity of our data, we could either work out an average demand or observe the frequency of demand levels. However, for the newsboy model, what we really want is to estimate demand probabilities which require a larger data set or fitting the data into a known distribution. Without complex calculations, we can't directly fit this data into a smooth distribution due to the limited sample size.

6. **Estimating Probabilities**: Due to the nature of the data provided and the scope of this explanation, let's simply identify the unique demand levels and their occurrences. Although this approach is not entirely rigorous due to the small sample size, it will give us an initial direction:

   - Demand of 2 occurred 4 times.
   - Demand of 5 occurred once.

   However, please note that using this data directly to calculate demand probabilities would not be entirely accurate for the newsboy model because of the small sample size and the simplistic approach.

7. **Decision**: The critical step in the newsboy model - deciding on the optimal order quantity - ideally relies on comparing the cumulative probability distribution of demand with the critical ratio. Yet, with the limited and non-distributed nature of our demand data, making a precise calculation following the theoretical model is not feasible here without making substantial assumptions or simplifications.

8. **Simplification for Solution**: The main concept we can take away is that the optimal order quantity should somewhat reflect the most common demand level in line with our CR, but without exact probability distribution data, choosing an optimal quantity directly from CR or past demand levels is challenging.

Given these constraints, while a rigorous application of the newsboy model isn't possible without more detailed demand probabilities, we can make a judgement based on observed demands. A cautious approach, balancing risk and potential sales, would consider ordering slightly above the most frequent demand level after considering overage and underage costs.

Given this, we might look at ordering quantities closest to frequently observed demand levels or slightly above, considering the overage cost isn't very high compared to the selling price.

**But to align with what's asked in the last line,** without directly calculable probabilities, I'd eye a quantity aligning close to your most common (or median when in doubt) demand observations, possibly erring towards the higher demand to capture more potential sales, but keeping in mind the cost implications.

The newsboy model, widely used in inventory management, aims to minimize the risk of underordering or overordering by finding an optimal balance that maximizes profit considering the overage cost (the cost of ordering too much) and the underage cost (the cost of ordering too little).

**Step 1: Understand Given Data**

Given historical data: [(20, 5), (8, 8), (16, 5), (14, 9), (17, 5)]
- Each tuple represents (order quantity, observed demand).

Selling price = $11
Ordering cost (overage cost) = $4
Underage cost = Selling price - Cost price (since not provided, we consider it as selling price - overage cost = $11 - $4 = $7).

**Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Demand**

First, let's list out the unique demand levels observed and their frequencies:
- Demand of 5: 3 times
- Demand of 8: 1 time
- Demand of 9: 1 time

Total observations = 5

Now, calculate the probability of each demand level:
- P(Demand=5) = 3/5
- P(Demand=8) = 1/5
- P(Demand=9) = 1/5

**Step 3: Determine the Critical Ration (CR)**

The critical ratio (CR) is calculated using the formula: CR = underage cost / (underage cost + overage cost)

Given that:
- Underage cost = $7
- Overage cost = $4

CR = 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11 â‰?0.6364

**Step 4: Match the CR to the Cumulative Probability of Demand**

Order the demand levels from low to high with their respective probabilities, and calculate the cumulative probabilities:
- Demand=5: P=3/5 (Cumulative probability = 3/5)
- Demand=8: P=1/5 (Cumulative probability = 4/5)
- Demand=9: P=1/5 (Cumulative probability = 5/5)

The target is to find a cumulative probability just above or equal to the CR of 0.6364.

Looking at the cumulative probabilities:
- Cumulative probability for Demand=5 is 0.6, which is below 0.6364.
- Cumulative probability for Demand=8 is 0.8, which is above 0.6364.

**Step 5: Determine Optimal Order Quantity**

Since the cumulative probability for a demand of 8 is the first to exceed the CR of 0.6364, the optimal order quantity that matches our CR criterion is for a demand of 8.

Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day, considering minimizing the risk between overordering and underordering using the given data and the newsboy model, is:

1. **Understanding the model**: The newsboy model aims to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes profit or minimizes cost when demand is uncertain. The critical decision is balancing the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too few (underage cost, which in your scenario is the lost profit from not selling as many as you could have, i.e., the difference between the selling price and the cost).

2. **Given Parameters**:
    - Selling price per item = $11
    - Ordering (overage) cost per item = $4
    - The underage cost per item (since not provided, this is inferred from the information) = Selling price - Ordering cost = $11 - $4 = $7.

3. **Historical Data**: [(7, 4), (9, 2), (8, 3), (7, 6), (5, 4)]. Each tuple represents (Order Quantity, Observed Demand).

4. **Calculating the Probability of Demand**: We need to understand the distribution of demand based on historical data to apply this in the model.
    - Demand values: [4, 2, 3, 6, 4]
    - Occurrences: 2, 4, 3, 6 (with 4 appearing twice, etc.)
    - Therefore, probabilities for each demand level can be calculated as the number of occurrences of each demand level divided by the total number of observations (5 in this case).

5. **Critical Ratio**: It's a key factor in the newsboy model, defining the optimal service level. It's the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of underage and overage costs: $\frac{\text{Underage Cost}}{\text{Underage Cost} + \text{Overage Cost}}$. Inserting our values: $\frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636$.

6. **Applying the Critical Ratio to Demand**: To find the optimal order quantity, one must find a point where the cumulative probability of demand is just greater than or equal to the critical ratio (0.636 in this case). This means we need to add up the probabilities of the observed demand amounts (in ascending order) until we meet or exceed 0.636.

7. **Cumulative Probabilities**: First, we need to calculate the individual probabilities of demands based on their occurrences in the provided data:
    - Demand probabilities will be estimated based on the frequency of each demand occurrence. In this case, we simplify the understanding that each observed demand has an equal chance, ignoring the exact probability calculation step for clarity and focusing on finding the demand level that matches the critical ratio approach.

8. **Matching Cumulative Probability to Critical Ratio**:
    - Given the simplification in step 7 (and acknowledging we've skipped explicit probability calculations for brevity), we would typically arrange demand levels in ascending order, compute cumulative probabilities, and select the demand level where the cumulative probability is just above the critical ratio.

9. **Conclusion**: Without detailed probability computations for each demand level (due to the simplification), the general approach involves comparing the demand distribution's shape to the critical ratio, aiming to select a demand level closely matching or exceeding the 0.636 mark. For precise optimization, one would calculate the exact cumulative probabilities of sorted demand levels to pinpoint where the curve crosses the critical ratio threshold.

Since the step involving explicit calculation of probability distribution and its cumulative comparison to the critical ratio was conceptually outlined but not numerically detailed, directly determining the optimal order quantity from the provided data under the precise guidelines of the newsboy model (with its critical step of matching cumulative probability to the critical ratio) would typically follow these principles but requires the actual probability calculations for pinpoint accuracy.

Given the outlined approach, the final stepâ€”identifying the exact optimal order quantityâ€”relies on those cumulative probability alignments which we simplified in our explanation. Ideally, one would commend numerical cumulative probabilities against each demand level to find where it meets or exceeds the critical ratio. Since we've abstracted from direct computations, for practical decision-making, closely examine similar historical demand patterns, and consider the critical ratio in context, leaning towards ordering quantities slightly above your average observed demand could be a thoughtful heuristic absent precise probability assessments.

For an accurate number based on the steps provided and generalized guidance, the specific numerical output is:

5,5,"[(14, 7), (16, 15), (19, 7), (11, 10), (19, 8)]",7.713652075,16.61979057,10,10,*,"To find the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy model using the provided data, we need to calculate the critical ratio first. The critical ratio (CR) is determined by the formula:

\[ CR = \frac{Selling Price - Ordering Cost}{Selling Price} \]

Plugging in the given selling price (\$11) and ordering cost (\$4) into this formula gives:

\[ CR = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

The critical ratio of approximately 0.636 means that the optimal inventory level should be set such that the probability of selling all units ordered is about 63.6%.

Step 1: Calculate the Demand Probability
We first need to analyze the historical demand data to estimate the probabilities. The given tuples represent the demand for each day:
[(14, 7), (16, 15), (19, 7), (11, 10), (19, 8)]

From these, we can extract the distinct demand quantities and their frequencies:
- 7 units: 2 times
- 15 units: 1 time
- 10 units: 1 time
- 8 units: 1 time

Over five observations, the probability of each demand level occurring is:
- P(Demand = 7) = 2/5 = 0.4
- P(Demand = 15) = 1/5 = 0.2
- P(Demand = 10) = 1/5 = 0.2
- P(Demand = 8) = 1/5 = 0.2

Step 2: Determine Cumulative Probabilities
To find the optimal order quantity, we need to align our critical ratio with the cumulative probability of demand.

Let's arrange the demand levels in ascending order and calculate the cumulative probabilities:
- 7 units: P = 0.4, Cumulative P = 0.4
- 8 units: P = 0.2, Cumulative P = 0.6
- 10 units: P = 0.2, Cumulative P = 0.8
- 15 units: P = 0.2, Cumulative P = 1.0

Step 3: Compare to the Critical Ratio
We're looking for the point where the cumulative probability is just over the critical ratio of 0.636. Inspecting the cumulative probabilities, we see that ordering enough stock to meet the demand of 8 units brings the cumulative probability to 0.6, which is just below the CR, and for 10 units, it's 0.8, which is above it. Therefore, the demand level that aligns best with our CR (closest to but not below it) is for 10 units.

The reasoning is thus: choose an order quantity that corresponds to a cumulative demand probability that is closest to but not less than the critical ratio.

Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day is:

This model aims to minimize the cost of either ordering too much or too little.

1. **Understand the Data**: The tuples provided represent (Order Quantity, Demand). Let's list them out for clarity:
   - (9, 6)
   - (9, 9)
   - (10, 10)
   - (9, 6)
   - (8, 6)

2. **Selling Price (P) and Overage Cost (C)**: According to the information, the selling price is $11, and the ordering (overage) cost is $4. The cost of understocking (Cu) can be calculated as P - C = $11 - $4 = $7.

3. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**: This is the ratio of the cost of understocking (Cu) to the sum of the costs of understocking (Cu) and overstocking (Co).
   - \( CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \)

4. **Identifying the Service Level**: This ratio represents the service level or the probability of not running out of stock before the next delivery. So, the service level would be:
   - Service Level = CR = 7/11 â‰?0.6364 or 63.64%

5. **Determine the Optimal Order Quantity**: To identify the optimal order quantity, we need to first find the distribution or probability of demand levels from the given historical data.

   Analyzing the demand data: [6, 9, 10, 6, 6] - It shows demand at levels of 6 units (three times), 9 units (once), and 10 units (once).

6. **Estimate Demand Probabilities**: Let's calculate the probabilities of each demand level occurring.
   - Probability of demand being 6 units = 3/5 = 0.6
   - Probability of demand being 9 units = 1/5 = 0.2
   - Probability of demand being 10 units = 1/5 = 0.2

7. **Cumulative Probability Distribution and Matching Service Level**: To find the optimal order quantity based on the service level (63.64%), we look for the demand level where the cumulative probability is just equal to or exceeds our service level.
   - Cumulative probability at 6 units = 0.6
   - Cumulative probability at 9 units = 0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8 (This exceeds our service level threshold)

   Since the demand of 9 units is the point at which the cumulative probability exceeds the service level of approximately 63.64%, we identify 9 as the next optimal order quantity.

9

This step-by-step reasoning leads us to deduce that the optimal order quantity for the next day is 9 units."
5,7,"[(18, 0), (11, 1), (18, 5), (11, 4), (17, 1)]",2.217826472,14.77938138,3,4,5,"To find the optimal order quantity according to the newsvendor (or newsboy) model with the given data, we need to follow these steps systematically.

### Step 1: Understanding the Model

The newsvendor model helps to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the expected cost or maximizes the expected profit when facing uncertain demand. The model requires three main pieces of information:

- The cost of ordering too many (overage cost, \(C_o\)), which is the cost per unit of ordering more than the demand. In our case, this is given as $4.
- The cost of ordering too few (underage cost, \(C_u\)), which is the revenue lost per unit for ordering less than the demand. This can be calculated as the selling price minus the cost per unit. However, only the selling price ($11) is explicitly provided. Thus, we interpret the lost revenue opportunity as the underage cost, $11, because we aren't given a specific cost per unit.
- The probability distribution of demand, which we have to infer from the provided historical demand data.

### Step 2: Calculating the Critical Ratio

The critical ratio (CR) is calculated by dividing the cost of undershooting demand (underage cost, \(C_u\)) by the total of both the cost of undershooting and overshooting demand (\(C_u + C_o\)). This ratio is crucial for determining the optimal service level.

\[CR = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o}\]

Given: \(C_u = 11\), \(C_o = 4\), 

\[CR = \frac{11}{11 + 4} = \frac{11}{15}\]

\[CR = 0.7333\]

### Step 3: Estimating Demand Distribution

From the historical data: [(18, 0), (11, 1), (18, 5), (11, 4), (17, 1)], we extract the demand figures to estimate its distribution: \[0, 1, 5, 4, 1\]

Letâ€™s organize this demand into ascending order for easier analysis: \[0, 1, 1, 4, 5\]

Since we do not have a continuous distribution nor a large sample size to precisely estimate probabilities for each demand value, we could treat each observed demand as equally likely. However, given the small dataset, we adjust this to acknowledge repeat values and real-world application purposes. The frequency of the demands are: 0 (once), 1 (twice), 4 (once), and 5 (once).

### Step 4: Calculating Optimal Order Quantity

We create cumulative probability distributions from the ordered demands and look for the first point where the cumulative probability exceeds the critical ratio, 0.7333.

- Cumulative probabilities for demands (naively assuming each unique demand scenario is equally likely, but adjusted for frequency):

  \[P(0) = 0.20\] (1/5)
  
  \[P(1) = 0.20 \times 2 = 0.40\] (due to frequency)
  
  \[P(4) = 0.20 + 0.40 = 0.60\] 
  
  \[P(5) = 0.20 + 0.60 = 0.80\] 

- The critical ratio of 0.7333 is first exceeded by the probability of ordering for a demand of 5.

Thus, the demand value where our cumulative probability first exceeds the CR is at demand = 5. This suggests an optimal order quantity to match the demand where the probability of selling all units is closest to the CR without going under, matching our constraints and maximizing expected profit.

### Optimal Order Quantity Conclusion

5"
5,8,"[(5, 5), (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 2), (2, 2)]",6.700840224,4.087115407,21,4,4,"To determine the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model from the given data, let's follow the process systematically. The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory problem, helps in deciding the optimal quantity to order for a product that has a single period of demand (like newspapers). This is particularly helpful when dealing with perishable goods or items with a short demand period. The goal is to find a balance between ordering too much and not enough, minimizing the overall cost.

**Step 1: Understand and Organize the Given Data**

The provided data consists of tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day: [(5, 5), (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 2), (2, 2)]. From this data, we understand that for every day listed, the order quantity perfectly matched the demand.

**Step 2: Define the Costs**

- Selling price per unit = \$11
- Ordering cost (overage cost) per unsold unit = \$4
- Shortage cost (underage cost) per unit = Selling price - Ordering cost = \$11 - \$4 = \$7

**Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**

The critical ratio is calculated using the formula: 

\[CR = \frac{\text{Underage Cost}}{\text{Underage Cost} + \text{Overage Cost}}\]

Substituting the values:

\[CR = \frac{7}{7+4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\]

**Step 4: Analyze Historical Demand to Determine the Optimal Order Quantity**

Given that our demand data exactly matches order quantities and no instances of overage or underage are provided, we infer the demand distribution directly from these observations: [5, 3, 4, 2, 2].

To find the optimal order quantity correlating with our critical ratio, we must analyze the demand distribution's cumulative probability and find the point where it closely matches or exceeds the critical ratio (CR).

1. Sort the demand data in ascending order: [2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2. Determine the cumulative probability of each demand level. Given the uniform distribution in our small sample:
   - P(Demand â‰?2) = 2/5 = 0.4
   - P(Demand â‰?3) = 3/5 = 0.6
   - P(Demand â‰?4) = 4/5 = 0.8
   - P(Demand â‰?5) = 5/5 = 1.0

The CR of 0.6364 falls between the cumulative probabilities of 0.6 (for a demand â‰?3) and 0.8 (for a demand â‰?4). Thus, according to the newsboy model, the optimal order quantity is the lowest quantity for which the cumulative probability of demand exceeds the CR. 

**Conclusion**

Given our calculations, the optimal order quantity for the next day is one that matches or exceeds the CR of approximately 0.6364 but is as close as possible to it to minimize losses. Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day is:

5,9,"[(22, 1), (19, 6), (17, 4), (25, 2), (17, 7)]",5.03400485,18.1127817,5,6,],"To apply the newsboy model, also known as the newsvendor model, we aim to find the optimal order quantity that maximizes profit by balancing the costs of ordering too many (overage cost) and ordering too few (underage cost). The key formula to remember is:

\[Cu = P - Co,\]

- where \(Cu\) is the underage cost (the cost of underordering, equal to the profit lost for each unit of demand not met),
- \(Co\) is the overage cost (the cost of overordering, equal to the cost per unit ordered minus any salvage value, which for simplicity here we'll consider as the ordering cost),
- and \(P\) is the selling price per unit.

Given data points: Selling price (\(P\)) is $11, and the ordering cost (\(Co\)) is $4. Therefore, the underage cost \(Cu = P - Co = 11 - 4 = $7\).

To find the optimal order quantity, we need the critical ratio, which is:

\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4}.\]

\[CR = \frac{7}{11} = 0.63636.\]

This ratio represents the probability of selling a unit without overstocking. To apply this, we need to analyze the demand data from the given tuples, [(22, 1), (19, 6), (17, 4), (25, 2), (17, 7)], focusing on the demand side, as [1, 6, 4, 2, 7].

1. Sort the demand data in ascending order: [1, 2, 4, 6, 7].
2. Calculate the cumulative probability for each demand level, dividing each position by the number of observations. In this case, there are 5 observations:

- For 1: \(P(Demand \leq 1) = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2\),
- For 2: \(P(Demand \leq 2) = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4\),
- For 4: \(P(Demand \leq 4) = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6\),
- For 6: \(P(Demand \leq 6) = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8\),
- For 7: \(P(Demand \leq 7) = 1.0\).

3. Match the critical ratio (CR = 0.63636) with the closest cumulative probability without going over it. The closest value is \(0.6\) for a demand of \(4\).

4. Look at the next higher demand level to identify the interval containing the CR. Between demands of \(4\) and \(6\), the CR suggests our optimal order quantity should aim to meet a demand level closer to \(4\) but considering the trend towards \(6\) since \(CR\) is closer to \(0.6\) but exceeding it.

Given our current approach leans on a simplified interpretation for illustrative purposes, and without interpolation (a more precise method could involve estimating the exact demand level corresponding to the CR), choosing the higher demand level closest to our CR, that is closer to but not less than the CR, would traditionally be more prudent for maximizing expected profit without significant overage risk.

Thus, based on the provided calculation method and understanding of the model:

\[Optimal Order Quantity = 6.\]"
5,10,"[(20, 4), (12, 6), (14, 7), (13, 5), (23, 7)]",6.648836318,13.37220591,6,7,],"To apply the newsboy model, also known as the single-period model, we need to calculate the optimal order quantity for products that have only one period of demand (e.g., newspapers). The model balances the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too little (underage cost). Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Define Given Parameters
- Selling price (\(p\)) = 11
- Ordering (overage) cost (\(c\)) = 4
- The data consists of tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day: \([(20, 4), (12, 6), (14, 7), (13, 5), (23, 7)]\)

### Step 2: Calculate Underage Cost (\(Cu\))
The underage cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost price per unit:
\[Cu = p - c = 11 - 4 = 7\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio is calculated using the formula:
\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{Cu}{p}\]
\[CR = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\]

### Step 4: Calculate Demand Probability
To calculate the demand probabilities, we must first understand the demand occurrences from the given data. Here are the demand frequencies:
- Demand of 4: 1 time
- Demand of 5: 1 time
- Demand of 6: 1 time
- Demand of 7: 3 times

Assuming these are the only possible demands, the probabilities are:
- P(Demand=4): \(1/5 = 0.20\)
- P(Demand=5): \(1/5 = 0.20\)
- P(Demand=6): \(1/5 = 0.20\)
- P(Demand=7): \(3/5 = 0.60\)

### Step 5: Cumulative Probability and Determining Order Quantity
The goal is to find the smallest demand \(D\) such that the cumulative probability \(P(X \le D)\) is just greater than or equal to the critical ratio (0.6364).

- Cumulative probability till demand = 4: 0.20 (Not enough)
- Cumulative probability till demand = 5: 0.40 (Not enough)
- Cumulative probability till demand = 6: 0.60 (Still not enough)
- Cumulative probability till demand = 7: 0.60 + 0.60 = 1.20 (Beyond, but this is our closest estimate given the steps)

In this interpretation, we adjust our perspective on cumulative probability calculation due to the discrete nature and direct information from our data. We aim for a more realistic application of the newsboy model acknowledging the given dataset's constraints and peculiarities.

Given the way we've approached the probabilities based on unique demand values and considering the nature of our data, our actual decision point lies right before hitting or surpassing the 0.6364 CR, which aligns with accepting the full range of represented demand.

Though cumulative probabilities traditionally don't exceed 1, in this context, moving step by step through the probabilities reflects how we address the sudden jump given the unique demand of 7 being very common. Hence, the direct picking of the highest represented demand for practical decisions.

### Step 6: Conclusion
Considering the interpretation and adjustment for direct application from our specific data scenario, the closest we get to crossing the CR with a realistic and practical rounding to the dataset's constraints leads us to lean on the higher represented demand value.

The optimal order quantity according to the revised interpretation and practical adaptation of the newsboy model, given the dataset and aiming for a straightforward, actionable decision, will be:

\[Order\ Quantity\ for\ the\ next\ day\ = 7\]"
5,11,"[(12, 10), (17, 13), (11, 8), (6, 6), (8, 8)]",8.347676007,9.447779262,12,10,*,"To deduce the optimal order quantity according to the newsboy (or newsvendor) model using the provided data, let's follow the steps below:

### 1. Understanding the Basic Terms
- **Selling Price (p)**: The revenue per unit sold, given as $11.
- **Cost per Unit (c)**: The cost of ordering each unit, given as $4.
- **Overage Cost (Co)**: The loss per unsold unit, which is the difference between the cost per unit and the salvage value (if any). Since no salvage value is given, it's simply the cost per unit, which is $4.
- **Underage Cost (Cu)**: The opportunity loss per unit for not having enough inventory to meet demand, calculated as the selling price minus the cost per unit, which is $11 - $4 = $7.

### 2. Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The CR is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage and overage costs:

\[ CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364 \]

### 3. Determine the Historical Demand Distribution
The demand from the data is: [10, 13, 8, 6, 8]. We'll use these to estimate the probability distribution of demand.

### 4. Estimate Demand Probabilities
From the given data:

- Demand of 6: 1 occurrence out of 5
- Demand of 8: 2 occurrences out of 5
- Demand of 10: 1 occurrence out of 5
- Demand of 13: 1 occurrence out of 5

Next, we would typically plot or calculate the cumulative probability distribution and find the demand level where the cumulative probability is just greater than or equal to the CR (0.6364).

### 5. Use the Demand Distribution to Find the Optimal Order Quantity
Given the small sample and simple integer demands, we can sort the demands and directly apply the CR to approximate the point in the demand distribution that meets or exceeds 0.6364. In doing so, keep in mind that with a larger and more continuous dataset, one would typically use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for this purpose.

- Sorted Demands: [6, 8, 8, 10, 13]
- Cumulative Probability advancements would be: 1/5 for 6, 3/5 by 8, 4/5 by 10, and 5/5 by 13.

Given our critical ratio of about 0.6364, the approximate matching point in the distribution by our calculated probabilities is after the occurrence of demand of 8 (3/5=0.6) and before or at the demand of 10 (4/5=0.8). Therefore, considering how to position our order quantity in smoothing the intersection of costs due to either overage or underage, **the optimal order quantity should cautiously be set just above the highest demand corresponding to a cumulative probability just below or equal to the critical ratio**. However, since 0.6364 is closer to 3/5 than to 4/5, and because in practice, one would ideally prefer leaning slightly towards meeting demand without significantly exceeding it (to manage overage costs), the suggestion might lean on a higher confidence figure but still conservative to limit overage costs.

Considering this analysis, the next optimal order quantity, rounding to the nearest whole number for practical purposes, could be considered **close to demand at the 0.6364 critical ratio mark, slightly more than 8 but less than 10, which means we round up**. However, in adhering strictly to how the newsboy model applies, you would generally target just above the demand at your CR. Given the incremental nature of our demands, a choice of **9 or 10 could be debated**; 9 for being conservative based on observed distributions, 10 for aligning more with CR expectation and allowing for slight overage room.

Considering that explanation, the specificity asked for is a single number for the next day's optimal order quantity, which nuances our decision. Thus, aligning closer to the CR interpretation directly:

**10**"
5,12,"[(9, 8), (14, 5), (13, 6), (12, 5), (16, 7)]",5.628894608,12.72954198,7,7,7,"To determine the optimal order quantity for the next day using the newsboy model, we start by understanding the model itself. The newsboy model is used to find the optimal inventory level that minimizes the costs or maximizes the profit under uncertainty in demand. It involves balancing the overage cost (the cost when the order quantity exceeds demand) against the underage cost (the cost when demand exceeds the order quantity).

Given data:
- Selling price = $11
- Ordering (overage) cost = $4

First, we need the underage cost (Cu), which is the lost profit for each unit not sold. This is the selling price minus the ordering cost.

\[ C_u = Selling\ price - Ordering\ Cost \]
\[ C_u = 11 - 4 = \$7 \]

Then, the critical ratio (CR) is calculated as the cost of underestimating demand (Cu) divided by the total of costs (Cost of underestimating plus cost of overestimating).

\[ CR = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o} \]
\[ CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} = 0.6364 \]

This ratio helps to determine the service level or the probability of meeting demand.

Next, we analyze the provided demand data to estimate the demand distribution or to find a percentile that matches the CR. The demands from the data provided are: 8, 5, 6, 5, 7.

To apply the CR and determine the optimal order quantity, we would ideally look at a demand distribution or use empirical data to find the demand percentile that matches the CR. However, given the simple dataset, let's identify a demand level that approximately aligns with our CR of 0.6364.

We order the demands: 5, 5, 6, 7, 8

If we calculate the cumulative probability of each demand level (in a simplistic manner due to small sample size), we are trying to find where it crosses the CR of 0.6364.

Assuming equal probability for each observed demand (since we don't have a better distribution), each has a probability of 1/5 = 0.2.

- Probability demand â‰?: 0.2 * 2 = 0.4
- Probability demand â‰?: 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6
- Probability demand â‰?: 0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8

The cumulative probability crosses the CR of 0.6364 between demand levels of 6 and 7. Therefore, considering the demand level that aligns with or is just above the CR is most aligned with the newsboy model strategy. Thus, we would aim for an order quantity that anticipates meeting a demand level of 7, as it is the closest above the calculated CR threshold.

The Newsboy model aims to find the balance between the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) and the missed opportunity for profit by not having enough items to meet demand (underage cost).

Step 1: **Understand the model's inputs**  
- **Cost of overordering (Co):** This is the cost of ordering one unit too many, given as \$4.
- **Selling price (P):** This is the price at which each unit is sold, given as \$11.
- **Cost of underordering (Cu):** This is the cost of ordering one unit too few, which can be calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost of ordering (P - Co) = \$11 - \$4 = \$7.

Step 2: **Calculate the critical ratio (CR)**  
The critical ratio is the fraction of the cost of underordering over the total cost of misordering (both over and under), which tells us the optimal service level. It's calculated as Cu/(Cu+Co).  
Let's calculate it:  
CR = \$7/(\$7+\$4) = 7/11 â‰?0.636.

Step 3: **Analyze the historical demand data**  
We have the following demand observations: 8, 8, 4, 7, 10. We need to determine the probability of each demand level, or at least an estimate for the demand distribution.

Let's assume linear probability for simplicity, though in practice, demand distribution could be analyzed more intricately.

Demand levels sorted: 4, 7, 8, 10.  
Probabilities (rough estimation):
- P(Demand â‰?4) = 1/5 = 0.20
- P(Demand â‰?7) = (counts of 4 and 7)/total observations = 2/5 = 0.40
- P(Demand â‰?8) = (counts of 4, 7, and 8)/total observations = 4/5 = 0.80
- Since 10 is the highest demand observed, P(Demand â‰?10) = 1.

Step 4: **Determine the optimal order quantity**  
The goal is to find the smallest demand level D, such that P(Demand â‰?D) is greater than or equal to the CR (0.636). Reviewing the probabilities calculated:

- P(Demand â‰?4) = 0.20 (Too low compared to CR)
- P(Demand â‰?7) = 0.40 (Still too low)
- P(Demand â‰?8) = 0.80 (This is the first demand level where P(Demand â‰?D) â‰?CR)

Since the demand level of 8 has a cumulative probability just over our CR, it suggests that aiming for meeting the demand level of 8 would align well with the optimal service level derived from the Newsboy model.

Step 5: **Recommendation**  
According to this model and the data provided, the optimal order quantity (considering the simplicity of the analysis and the distribution assumption) would be to match the demand level where the cumulative probability exceeds or meets the critical ratio, which in this case is:

5,14,"[(21, 13), (8, 8), (27, 10), (12, 11), (14, 14)]",8.511172201,16.20814204,14,13,3,"To utilize the newsvendor (also known as the newsboy model) to deduce the optimal order quantity for the next day, we'll follow a structured approach:

### 1. Understanding the Model
The newsvendor model is a method used to determine the optimal inventory level that minimizes the risk of having too much or too little stock. It involves balancing the cost of ordering too many items (overage cost) against the cost of ordering too few (underage cost). In this scenario, the overage cost is the cost of ordering a unit that isn't sold, which is given as 4 (the ordering cost). The underage cost is the lost profit for each unit not stocked and sold, which can be calculated as the selling price minus the ordering cost (11 - 4 = 7).

### 2. Calculating Critical Ratio (CR)
The Critical Ratio (CR) is a crucial component in the newsboy model, representing the optimal service level. It is calculated as:
\[ CR = \frac{Underage Cost}{Underage Cost + Overage Cost} \] 
\[ = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.636 \]

### 3. Finding the Demand Probability Distribution
To apply the critical ratio, we first need to estimate the demand probability distribution from the historical data. Let's calculate the frequency of each demand level from the provided tuples [(21, 13), (8, 8), (27, 10), (12, 11), (14, 14)]:

- Observed demand values: 13, 8, 10, 11, 14
- Total observations: 5

The probability of each demand level is the frequency of the demand over the total observations. But from the provided data, each demand level occurs exactly once, so the probability of each demand level occurring is 1/5 or 0.20 (since each is unique in this sample).

### 4. Cumulative Probability Distribution
To determine the optimal order quantity, we'll find the demand level where the cumulative probability is just greater than or equal to the CR (0.636).

- Ordering cumulative probabilities for demands in ascending order:
  
  Demand:  8, 10, 11, 13, 14
  Probability: 0.2 for each demand level
  Cumulative Probability: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0

### 5. Matching Cumulative Probability to Critical Ratio
The CR of 0.636 falls between the cumulative probabilities of 0.6 and 0.8, corresponding to demand levels of 11 and 13 respectively. Therefore, the optimal order quantity should ensure a service level that just exceeds a cumulative probability of 0.636, suggesting an order quantity just above the demand level of 11.

### 6. Determining Optimal Order Quantity
Given the cumulative probabilities, the optimal order point is right after the cumulative probability exceeds the CR of 0.636, which occurs at a demand level of 13 since it's the first point with a cumulative probability (0.8) above 0.636. Hence, to align with this model, the next day's optimal order quantity should be closely aligned with the demand level of 13, as this meets the service level required by the CR.

1. **Understanding the Cost Structures**: The selling price per unit is 11, and the overage cost per unit is 4. This overage cost is essentially the cost of ordering one unit too many, equivalent to the ordering cost in this case.

2. **Estimating Demand Probabilities**:
   - We'll begin by determining the demand distribution from the provided historical data. The observed demands are 4, 4, 3, 4, and 9.

3. **Calculating the Critical Ratio (CR)**:
   - The critical ratio can be calculated using the formula: \[CR = \frac{Selling Price - Overage Cost}{Selling Price}\]
   - Plugging in the numbers: \[CR = \frac{11 - 4}{11} = \frac{7}{11}\]
   - So, CR = 0.63636...

4. **Matching the Critical Ratio with Cumulative Demand Probabilities**:
   - First, we need to compute the cumulative demand probabilities. To do so, we'll normalize the historical demand frequencies to probabilities and then calculate cumulative probabilities.

5. **Estimating Cumulative Demand Probabilities**:
   - The unique demands observed are 3, 4, and 9. To find their probabilities, we note the frequency of each demand:
     - Demand of 3: 1 occurrence out of 5 (Probability = 0.20)
     - Demand of 4: 3 occurrences out of 5 (Probability = 0.60)
     - Demand of 9: 1 occurrence out of 5 (Probability = 0.20)
   - Cumulative probabilities then are:
     - Cumulative probability for demand â‰?3: 0.20
     - Cumulative probability for demand â‰?4: 0.20 + 0.60 = 0.80
     - Cumulative probability for demand â‰?9: 1.00 (0.20 + 0.60 + 0.20)

6. **Finding the Optimal Order Quantity**:
   - We look for the demand value where the cumulative probability is just greater than or nearest to the CR (0.63636...). From the cumulative probabilities calculated:
     - The CR falls between the cumulative probabilities for demand â‰?4 (0.80) and demand â‰?3 (0.20).
   - Given our CR and the structured cumulative probabilities, the optimal order quantity for the next day should be chosen where the cumulative probability is just above or equal to the CR. So, we choose the demand of 4 as it corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.80, which is the nearest above the CR.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Since demand of 4 has the cumulative probability closest to but not less than the CR, ordering according to this demand level matches our need to optimize the balance between overage and understock.

8. **Output**:

For the optimal order quantity for the next day:

The selling price per unit, the cost per unit, the overage cost, and the probability distribution of demand are crucial components of this calculation.

Given data:
- Selling price = $11
- Overage cost (ordering cost) = $4
The underage cost (lost profit) per unit is the selling price minus the cost per unit, which in this context appears to be the difference between the selling price and the overage cost since no other cost is provided. Thus, underage cost = $11 - $4 = $7.

### Step 1: Calculate the Critical Ratio
The critical ratio (CR) is calculated as CU / (CO + CU), where CU is the underage cost, and CO is the overage cost. Plugging in the numbers:
CU = $7
CO = $4
\[ CR = \frac{CU}{CU+CO} = \frac{7}{7+4} = \frac{7}{11} \]

\[ CR \approx 0.636 \]

### Step 2: Determine the Demand Probability Distribution
From the tuples provided, we calculate the relative frequency of demand levels as an estimation of their probability. The observed demands are: 2, 6, 4, 4, 5. 

To calculate the probabilities, let's first tally the demands:
- Demand of 2: 1 occurrence
- Demand of 4: 2 occurrences
- Demand of 5: 1 occurrence
- Demand of 6: 1 occurrence

Since there are 5 observations, the probability of each demand level is as follows:
- P(Demand=2) = 1/5
- P(Demand=4) = 2/5
- P(Demand=5) = 1/5
- P(Demand=6) = 1/5

### Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Probabilities
The cumulative probability of demand being less than or equal to a certain quantity helps us compare against the critical ratio. We order these demand levels and calculate the cumulative probabilities:
- Cumulative P(Demand â‰?2) = 1/5
- Cumulative P(Demand â‰?4) = 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5
- Cumulative P(Demand â‰?5) = 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5
- Cumulative P(Demand â‰?6) = 4/5 + 1/5 = 1

### Step 4: Find the Optimal Order Quantity
We look for the smallest order quantity for which the cumulative probability is greater than or equal to the CR of 0.636. Observing the calculated cumulative probabilities:
- The cumulative probability of ordering up to 4 units matches this criterion, as it stands at 0.6 (3/5), but we're looking for the first instance where cumulative probability exceeds our CR.

Thus, the next threshold, a demand of 5 units, with a cumulative probability of 0.8 (4/5), meets the requirement of being greater than the CR of 0.636. 

So, the optimal order quantity for the next day, as determined by the newsboy model with our given data and approximations, would be:

5,17,"[(14, 6), (16, 10), (17, 4), (15, 15), (14, 9)]",7.878331579,13.29864637,10,10,0,"To find the optimal order quantity using the newsboy model given the historical order and demand data, we first need to understand what the newsboy model is. The newsboy model, also known as the single-period inventory problem, is a decision model to determine the optimal order quantity for a product that has a single period of demand, such as newspapers. The goal is to find the order quantity that maximizes profit or minimizes cost, taking into account the cost of ordering too many (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too few (underage cost). The cost of ordering too many is the difference between the cost of ordering and the salvage value, while the cost of ordering too few is the lost profit on each item not sold. The formula involves calculating the critical ratio, which is the cost of a shortage divided by the total of the shortage and overage costs. 

Given:
- Selling price per unit: $11
- Cost per unit (overage cost): $4
- Underage cost: This would be the selling price minus the ordering cost ($11 - $4 = $7), as we lose out on $7 of profit for each unit we could have sold but didn't have in stock.

The critical ratio is thus calculated as: \(\frac{\text{Underage Cost}}{\text{Underage Cost + Overage Cost}} = \frac{7}{7+4} = \frac{7}{11}\).

Now, to apply the model using the data provided, first, we need to calculate the demand probabilities. The historical data are tuples representing the order quantity and the observed demand for each day: [(14, 6), (16, 10), (17, 4), (15, 15), (14, 9)].

Let's calculate the frequency of each demand level and then compute its probability:
- Demand = 4: 1 occurrence
- Demand = 6: 1 occurrence
- Demand = 9: 1 occurrence
- Demand = 10: 1 occurrence
- Demand = 15: 1 occurrence

Since there are 5 observations, each demand level has a probability of \(1/5 = 0.20\) (20%).

Now, we aim to find a demand level (D) where the cumulative probability (P(D â‰?d)) is just above or equal to our critical ratio (7/11 â‰?0.636). Let's estimate this using the demand probabilities:
- P(D â‰?4) = 0.20
- P(D â‰?6) = 0.40
- P(D â‰?9) = 0.60
- P(D â‰?10) = 0.80

We observe that moving from a demand of 9 to a demand of 10, the cumulative probability jumps from 0.60 to 0.80. The critical ratio of 0.636 falls between these two probabilities, which implies the optimal demand level (to inform our order quantity) should be closest to this jump, i.e., demand of 10 units.

Therefore, considering the balance between the risk of overstocking and understocking according to the newsboy model and based on the historical demand data, the optimal order quantity for the next day is:

5,18,"[(17, 4), (17, 8), (21, 2), (19, 4), (23, 1)]",2.421897184,19.35305533,4,4,4,"To apply the newsboy model (also known as the newsvendor model) to determine the optimal order quantity, we follow these steps, incorporating the given order and demand data. This model aims to balance the costs of ordering too much (overage) against the costs of ordering too little (underage).

### Step 1: Understand and Assign Given Data
We have tuples representing order quantity and observed demand, selling price per unit (p) = $11, and overage cost per unit (c) = $4.

Given data tuples: \[(17, 4), (17, 8), (21, 2), (19, 4), (23, 1)\]

### Step 2: Calculate Underage Cost (Cu)
The underage cost (Cu) is the lost profit for each unit not ordered but for which there was demand. It's calculated as the selling price minus the ordering cost:

\[Cu = p - c = 11 - 4 = \$7\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)
The critical ratio is the ratio of the underage cost to the total of the underage and overage costs. This gives us the service level, or the optimal in-stock probability, that balances these costs.

\[CR = \frac{Cu}{Cu + Co} = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11}\]

\[CR \approx 0.636\]

### Step 4: Determine the Optimal Order Quantity
To find the optimal order quantity, we should calculate the demand distribution and find the demand level at which the cumulative probability is closest to the critical ratio.

Given demand values from the tuples: \[4, 8, 2, 4, 1\]

Sorting demand values in ascending order: \[1, 2, 4, 4, 8\]

Given this small dataset, we can calculate the cumulative probability for each demand level by counting the instances equal to or below a certain demand divided by the total number of observations.

1. For demand = 1, cumulative probability = 1/5 = 0.2
2. For demand = 2, cumulative probability = (1 + 1)/5 = 0.4
3. For demand = 4, cumulative probability = (1 + 1 + 2)/5 = 0.8

The optimal order quantity is the first demand level where the cumulative probability exceeds (or is closest to) the CR.

Given CR â‰?0.636, the closest cumulative probability without going under is for a demand of 4.

### Step 5: Determination of the Optimal Order Quantity
Based on the calculations, the optimal order quantity for the next day, aiming to align with the CR and given demand distribution, is:

The model aims to find the order quantity that maximizes profit or minimizes costs when demand is uncertain, by balancing the costs of ordering too much against the costs of ordering too little.

Given data: [(18, 5), (15, 5), (17, 7), (21, 6), (20, 5)]
Selling price per unit ($P) = 11
Ordering cost per unit, also referred to as overage cost ($C) = 4
Critical ratio (CR) is not directly provided but is pivotal for calculations.

1. **Calculate Probability Distribution of Demand**: To understand demand patterns better, ascertain observed demands and their respective probabilities.
    - Demand occurrences: 5 (three times), 6 (once), 7 (once).
    - Total observations: 5.
    - Probability of demand = 5: 3/5, 6: 1/5, 7: 1/5.

2. **Determine the Critical Ratio (CR)**: This is a pivotal factor in the newsboy model. CR is essentially the ratio of the cost of under-ordering (Cu) (the lost profit per unit) to the total of the cost of over-ordering (Co) and the cost of under-ordering (Cu). However, Co here is equivalent to the ordering cost, and Cu can be obtained from the difference between the selling price and the ordering cost.
    - Co = $C = 4.
    - The cost of under-ordering (Cu) = $P - $C = 11 - 4 = 7. 
    - CR = Cu / (Cu + Co) = 7 / (7 + 4) = 7 / 11.

3. **Compute the Optimal Order Quantity**:
    - We need to find where the cumulative probability of demand is just greater than or equal to the CR.
    - Cumulative probability distribution from the given demand probabilities:
        - P(Demand â‰?5) = 3/5.
        - P(Demand â‰?6) = 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5.
        - P(Demand â‰?7) = 3/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 = 1.
    - CR = 7/11 â‰?0.636.
    - Looking at our cumulative probabilities, the optimal order point is where the cumulative probability exceeds or equals CR. Thus, since P(Demand â‰?5) = 3/5 = 0.6, which is less than CR, and P(Demand â‰?6) = 4/5 = 0.8, which is just over CR, the optimal order quantity corresponds to the demand just greater than CR, which is a demand of 6.

According to the newsboy model and our calculations, to align with the principle of minimizing the total cost while considering probabilities of demand and the critical ratio,

This model, often used to determine the optimal inventory level, involves balancing the cost of ordering too much (overage cost) and the cost of ordering too little (underage cost). Here, the overage cost is the difference between the ordering cost and the salvage value (if any), and the underage cost is the missed profit from not meeting demand.

Given:
- Selling price = $11
- Ordering cost = $4
Thus, the overage cost is $4, as no salvage value is mentioned. The underage cost is the missed profit, which is the selling price minus the ordering cost: $11 - $4 = $7.

1. **Calculate the Critical Ratio (CR)**: The CR is the ratio of the underage cost to the sum of the underage cost and the overage cost. \[CR = \frac{Underage Cost}{Underage Cost + Overage Cost}\]
\[CR = \frac{7}{7 + 4} = \frac{7}{11} \approx 0.6364\]

2. **Determine the demand probabilities**: We need to estimate the probability distribution of demand based on historical data. The demand observations are 6, 0, 3, 1, and 6 again. We can note these demands and their frequencies. Then, by preparing a cumulative probability distribution, we identify the demand level closest to the CR.

From the data, the unique demands are 0, 1, 3, and 6. The frequencies of these demands are:
- 0 occurs 1 time
- 1 occurs 1 time
- 3 occurs 1 time
- 6 occurs 2 times

Total observations = 5.

The probabilities are:
- P(0) = 1/5
- P(1) = 1/5
- P(3) = 1/5
- P(6) = 2/5

The cumulative probabilities are:
- Cumulative P(0) = 1/5
- Cumulative P(1) = 2/5
- Cumulative P(3) = 3/5
- Cumulative P(6) = 5/5

3. **Match cumulative probability with CR**: You want your cumulative probability to be just at or slightly above the CR. In this case, our CR is approximately 0.6364. Looking at the cumulative probabilities, 3/5 (or 0.6) is below the CR, and 5/5 (or 1) is well above it. There's no direct match, but the closest one that does not exceed the CR significantly is the demand level at 6 since that is our next cumulative probability step that goes above the CR.

4. **Determine the optimal order quantity**: Based on the above analysis and considering our method of rounding to the closest demand level, the optimal order quantity considering our CR and cumulative probabilities would be the demand level closest to but not less than the CR, which is 6 units.

Therefore, the optimal order quantity for the next day, according to the newsboy model based on provided demand data, is:
